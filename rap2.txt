Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (woo)
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it

Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank, check in my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here?
Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom?
Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum
Put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless
Lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless
Largest in charge
And born in New Orleans
Get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly
Drake, Tunechi, and Barbie
You know!

Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture!
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation!
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish

Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean
Get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
‘Cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch

God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though

All I gotta say is "sayonara, nigga"
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga

Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'

Sometimes I ask God, "Man, why him?"
Like the team that I would never leave behind

They say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that, true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower

Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag

They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers

Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it

Look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the..

Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again

I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see that guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin' at the..

Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend

So why are we here talking to each other again

Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn, I look just like my fucking dad

I see the change, I see the message
And no message coulda been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the..

Mirror on the wall, here we are again MJ taught me that

Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it

And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me

Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Muthafuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade

President Carter, Young Money Democrat

Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryin' to get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, motherfucker
‘Cause all this bullshit done made me strong, motherfucker

So I pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
My word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I can pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

It hurts, but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove
I just stand up and scream: "Fuck 'em all!"

Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in
This roof is cavin' in, up it's time to raise it, then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mines got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another
I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole
My confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'—

Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

Just saw an alien saucer approaching from the sky
Radio contact has been attempted but cannot be established Instructions are to prepare for an attack by an unknown enemy

Fo’ fo’ bulldog: my motherfucking pet

But if she get greedy, I’ma starve her to death
Top down, it’s upset
Been fucking the world and nigga I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking 'bout a sketch

Prepared for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch I got my hand up her dress

The end of time is like a hour away

Damn, military minded, lost and can’t find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket. Bitch, sit on my rocket
I’m wired out the socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there’s food for thought then I’m guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want – I took heed yea
Now let it breathe, yea

Back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she’s so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what’s appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain’t that a bitch? I’m just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshener
I don’t play, boy, I ain’t Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It’s a cold world, I put on a mink
There’s a chain of command, I’m the missing link

God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
And I’m smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet

Here we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket. Bitch, sit on my rocket
I’m wired out the socket, but still shockin'
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today ?

The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

Fifty mill in one room, you, you could ask anyone out here
Who running the game? And they’ll tell you the truth
Man, they'll tell you
Oh look, they fuck with me now
I think they’re hearin' me now
Someone said "Nigga they takin' you seriously now"
I’m like "I think they just might be scared of me now"
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day, niggas wrong every day
Go, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain’t ever have to play it safe
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin' out of space
Mothafucka that’s grindin'

She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend, man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it "Waynes" it pours
No really, I'm on my "fuck that bitch" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

Coconut Ciroc
Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock
Well, and I wish I never met ya
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not four-ever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy F, for "fuck you"

No ain't nothing going on
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here girl, I'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song I'm writing for you
Now I see how you can be
I don't want you 'round you me all you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cause girl done taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything

I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?

Dear Anne, my number one fan
I write with the light from the lamp on my night stand
With my pen in my right hand and that's also my mic hand
Codeine in a Sprite can, ink on the white pad
And I'm thinking of life, Anne, and wrong and right, Anne
And sometimes I'm right and sometimes I might
Cannot find the light still my rhymes are bright
So I continue my plan and I'm sure like white sand
That they'll be price paying before my flight land
But still, I want to see more than my sight can
Adore so I can't ignore what I want anymore
So I just go you can call me the goer
And oh, yeah, I got a girl, she act like I owe her
And uhm, sometimes it seems like I just don't know her
And yeah, the relationship is starting to feel like a chore
But I really hope I'm not starting to bore, page one

Dear Anne, my number one fan
I write you this letter, I hope everything's grand
I hope everyone's good, I hope everybody's praying
I hope, hold up baby, let me switch hands
See, lately I've been dealing with a lot of shit, Anne
It's burning me and I can't get out of this pan
And everytime I look there's a problem with this man
But I ain't tryna expose, I'm just tryna expand
But your support held me up like kickstands
And I'm also being more careful in how I pick friends
Anne, I'm trying to stay up out them chicks' pants... but I just can't
But on another note, this ain't just another note
This is more than a rap, this is more of an oath
And I know you're wondering what this letter is for
And I'm just hoping that you read this far, page two

Dear Anne, my number one fan
By now, you probably think that I'm portraying who I'm saying
And sometimes I wish I wasn't him but I am
And it's people like you that make me proud of what I am
Hey, you are the shit, damn, pardon the gram'
But it's like you make me feel like I'm a part of the fam
And shit, when my life is like some sort of exam
It's a jungle out there, lions, horses and rams
Shit, as I sit and wait for the war to begin
I just think of you then I'm rewarded again, Anne
With you is where my artistry can, Anne
So with you is where a part of me stands, Anne
I hope I see you in the stands, Anne
Because you know I understand, Anne
And I'm sorry about Stan
So I wrote this to say that I'm your number one fan

Yo, yo Drew and Inf
This-this, this right here is crazy

I heard somebody say "Church", I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got Summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the Sun
Got Spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never Fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: "Wayne quit!"
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call them April babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream "Soo-woo" and "Da-da-doe"
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

Hey, Mr. Carter (Young! I am him)

I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share, mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!

It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, "What up, killa?" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, baby!

Hey, Mr. Carter (amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Yeah)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching

Hey, Mr. Carter
Tell me, where have you been?
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why

And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Ahh, we'll lose two lives: yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve

Woo, this that shit they didn’t want me on
I’m ‘bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne, aroma wrong
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lam, I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in the wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little girls
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure
I know how to hack a jeweller ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, Holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, 'Cock-a-doodle'
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, glory unto you, glory

I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new
I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boo-boo, I got them spooked too
I drive in neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther
I'm not a chooser, your mom a cougar, I sock it to her
My cocaine white as a white beluga, I like bazookas
I'm high as lunar, I'm wilder than tigers, Nikes, Pumas
Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said, 'Surprise', but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this fuckin' artist drawin' is the art of war
These niggas' soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?

Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely, when sortin' out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'
Lord, oh, Lord

Am I talkin' crazy, too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads' elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest
My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private, tell the pilot, 'Be quiet, we need our privacy'
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, took you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory

Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tires Lucas, my driver's crusin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies
I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human
You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi
You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'em

You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?

I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushing the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargaining on cocaine
So in other words nigga, do your thing

Mind in one place heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you niggas
Who dont have your heart in your rap shit and got too fuckin comfy
Cause we still fuckin hungry, Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, fuckin faded, aww yeah I'm fuckin faded
They tellin’ lies about me, aww yeah I must've made it
Rikers Island on this flow, 8 months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
Three visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out

Stop playin, I ain't with that bullshit
Niggas act like bitches, shanaynay, oh my goodness
This is Wayne’s world, and y’all are just some tourists
Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish, you would bitch
Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder
Two Glock 40′s, nigga you got 80 problems
Swimmin’ in the money, I'mma need some fuckin goggles
It's better to give, but we don't give a fuck about 'em
I just came home, shit done got real, ho
Lil Weezy-ana, the boot nigga, steel toe
I ain't workin with a full deck but I deal ho
I just touched down, kick the motherfucking field goal
Talkin ’bout baby money? I got your baby money
Kidnap your bitch, get that "how-much-you-love-your-lady" money
I know you fake nigga, press your brakes nigga
I’ll take you out, that’s a date nigga
I'm a grown ass blood, stop playin with me
Play asshole and get an ass whippin’
I think you pussy cat, ha, hello kitty
I just throw the alley-oop to Drake Griffin
I lay 'em down, tempur-pedic
This shits a game of chess, you niggas think it's cleavage
Its Young Money, yeah, tis the season
I give you the business, bitch this a business meeting
My niggas hungry, my bitches greedy
Will I die a bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija
Nigga, I'm straight, my girl a faggot
Potato on the barrel, pop pop potato salad

Look what you made me do
Me! That's who
I'm sorry for the wait, I'm sorry for the wait (Tell 'em)
Tha Carter gon' be late so I cooked up a tape (Tell 'em!)
The garden's full of snakes so I had to escape
Lil homie gon' be straight, lil homie gon' be straight!
Woo, oh

And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
Yeah, and I'm sorry for the wait too
I told myself to save yourself 'cause I can't save you
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
Fuck it, this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
I ain't trippin' – I got Barbie, I got Drake too
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Boop

Who kept this shit together? Nigga, me, that's who
Who was there when niggas left us? Nigga, me, that's who
Cash Money is an army, I'm a one man army
And if them niggas comin' for me, I'm goin' out like Tony
(Bap-bap-bap-bap)
Now I don't want no problems, I just want my money
Ain't gotta hold no conversation, nor my luggage
Tell whoever's countin' that I'm on a hundred
Woo, Birdman Junior – more like Ugly Duckling

Takin' over, now I'm takin' over, yeah
Think it over? Bitch, I'm thinkin' forward, ta
I'm sippin' lean out a glass, nigga
All I got is Young Money – no more Cash, nigga
Ayy


And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
No more am I my brother's keeper – Cain and Abel
Young Money sharp, I'm still eatin', I just chipped my tooth
Tell them niggas – No love lost, 'cause I ain't got shit to lose
I told myself to save yourself 'cause I can't save you
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
I found the needle in the haystack, put the thread through
I tried to stitch the wound back up, but I just bled through
Yeah

It's compensation over conversation
(Money talks)
Lord I must got blurry vision, a nigga's got two faces
Lord, this game is a vampire
Blood, you gotta protect your neck
It'll suck you dry like raisins, Lord
But fuck that, nigga
Got it drawn out
Fuck that nigga, I'mma ball out
The day you met me is the day Hell froze
On the day I left is when it thawed out
I'm still in the buildin'
I just had to knock a couple walls down
Had to kick y'all out
Life is a movie
But sometimes a nigga get too tired of watchin'
And walk out

Takin' over, Lord I'm takin' over
Dropped the Sorry 4 The Wait until the wait is over
Sippin' lean out a flask, nigga
And all I do is smoke, fuck, and thrash, nigga
Ayy

And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
Fuck these haters, throw your board up if you skate too
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Tunechi – niggas don't appreciate you
You've been down since day one
It meant nothin' on day two (Damn)
Sometimes the truth is hard to swallow
And to say, too
But I graduated from that bullshit
Now I hate school

And now I'm takin' over, now I'm takin' over
The old me dead and gone, that's who I'm prayin' over
Might have to go back to slangin' yola 'til the wait is over
If so, then I got bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda...

Lollipop, lollipop, breastses just like Dolly Parton
She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot, 'til she ask
"How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take 'til she get to shop?"
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze?
Tell her, "Girl, like Doritos, that's not yo cheese"
Tell her friends, "Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to la."
I can't only have one and I ain't tryin' to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gonna melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type of respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold chicken soup won't help
We need fo' mo' hoes, we need oh-oh-oh-oh!
You know what it is when we're outta town
We ball in two-seats, and you out of bounds
So come here, baby girl
You're now fuckin' with the best in the world
Lollipop, the best in the world

She lick me like a lollipop
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps


Shawty say she wanna lick the wrapper
And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-flickin' actor
I Anita Bake her, now she caught up in that Rapture
I got so much chips I swear they call me Hewlett Packard
I got so much chips you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy motha-fudge cake, now tell me how that fudge tastes
I do it for Bloods' sake, soo-woo
Think it's voodoo how that roof do di-di-dissipate
Your girl wants to participate
She so so sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then my diamonds are in the choir
Because they sang from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang, because all she do is bang
Like Ricky Martin, Wayne and Kanye: pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment
With Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it

Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I flushed out the feelin' of me bein' the shit
'Cause I was leavin' skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-n-Go
And I can go anywhere: innie, minnie, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD thing, tape deck
IPod, your girlfriend, and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex
'Cause you don't want that late text, that "I think I'm late" text
So wrap it up!
But he's so sweet she wanna lick the wrapper

Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

Man, fuck these niggas!

Futuristic handgun

Ask Tity Boi, no pity boy, this scar city the city boy
So icy, so no Nike boy, just Gucci, Louis, Prada, 'scuse me
"Gucci Mane keep shittin' on me, why that boy keep buyin' jewelry?"
East Atlanta cockin' hammers, bandannas on car antennas
No, we do not talk to strangers, just cut off these niggas' fingers
Gucci’s armed and dangerous, cocaine, codeine and angel dust
This AK-47 will hitchya everywhere from the ankle up
Gun same size as Nia Long, clip long as a Pringles can

Swagger so bright, I don’t even need light
I’m with a model broad, she don’t even eat rice
But would you believe that she eat dykes?
And she asked me for a picture, so I gave her 3 strikes
Yeah, I-I’m the man around this motherfucker
I’m so hot you probably catch a tan around this motherfucker
This rap game, I got my hand around this motherfucker
Yeah I said game, but I ain’t playing around this motherfucker
Yeah, I’m the best to ever do it, bitch
And you’re the best at never doing shit
If you the shit, then I am sewerage
T-try me and I’ll have your people reading eulogies
I swear you can’t fuck with me
But I can fuck your girl and make her nut for me
Then slut for me, then kill for me, then steal for me
And of course it’ll be your cash
Then I'll murder that bitch and send her body back to your ass

And we don’t want no problems
Ok, you’re a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?

I fuck around and leave a nigga's brains on the street
Ughh, I pop that pussy

Swallow my bullets, and don’t you spit
Uhh! I am the hip-hop socialist
Life is a gamble and I’m all about my poker chips
Do you want a dose of this? I will make the most of this
'F' is for ferocious, murder your associates
The top is so appropriate, this is just where I belong
Keep a hard dick for your girlfriend to wobble on, Weez!

And we don’t want no problems
Ok, you’re a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?

I fuck around and leave a nigga's brains on the street

Before I eat that pussy, I say my grace
Girl I'm nastier than him, I don't know why you still with him
Beat that pussy, go to sleep, she got that Tylenol P.M
Fuck that bitch until she tired, 'til she tired like a rim
Give her head like a brim, it tastes good, M-M-M
Pussy monster in her closet, full of surprises
I give full body massages, I hope that pussy smell like a violet
I hope that pussy warmer than luke and sweet as Godiva
Suck this dick and swallow that nut and call it Penis colada
Lift up that mini-skirt, that's my dinner desert
She fell in love with the Martian, I said you too down to Earth
Man, these hoes love Wayne, got a bunch of dimes, that's chump change
This shit is target practice and your bitch is my gun range

My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK

Down here waiting for her to come like payday
Hoping this juice is sweeter than baked cake
She say it's for Tunechi, she lie with a straight face
But I'm trying to eat healthier, so I ate a veggie
Sucked on that pussy, I feel better already
She say "Tunechi go slower" and Tunechi went faster
My tongue is a motor, my dick is a NASCAR
Whipped cream on that pussy, dickhead like a bullet
If her hair real I'mma pull it, hope that ass feel like a cushion
I give her wood when he wouldn't? I hope that pussy tastes like pudding
And I get that ho the boot, hold up, let me put my foot in (Tunechi)
Got a sweet tooth, candy yam pussy

Ok, the baddest bitch in this bitch, got the fattest clique in this bitch
You might drown, you better start doggy paddling in this bitch
I'm Trin, B nigga? Queen nigga, sleep in this pussy, dream nigga
I stay on that dick like a fucking balance beam nigga
Hair pull, neck grab, don't fuck with hoes that backstab
Don't fuck with niggas that ain't got shit, if I fucked a nigga then that's my dick
My mouth a jacuzzi, my pussy a safe place
Fuck me 'til daybreak, then you can go skate, Trina

But baby lets face it, I'm not into dating
I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I've been chasing
These hearts I've been breaking
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
They like it in a head lock fuck 'em from behind
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, put it to the side
Feelings to the side like a don do
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got a hotel-crib
Got niggas that'll die for the prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death
Left town in a coach came back in a jet

I'm good, I'm not living like I did before
I'm good, I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, said I'm good
Oh, I been good
I've been out there puttin' down that work
I'm good, said I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, motherfucker I'm good

This is dedicated to everybody who forgot
Forgetful motherfuckers
Remember, don't you remember?
I been good, we good

I'm facing the bottle for all of my problems
These Instagram models are nothing but trouble
She's going away now, I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models, I said they're nothing but trouble

When I met her she was out for love
Yeah, I bought her leather and some diamond studs
Damn, when I met her she was molly'd up
Fuck it, I said "Whatever" 'cause I'm not a judge
No, all my niggas say she's not what's up
Uh, I considered it but not enough
Uh, she just wanted to be popular
Uh, she just want ten thousand followers
Lord, she posted, she posted, she posted
They like it, they like it, repost it
She party promotin', she hostin'
She posin', legs open, provokin'
It got my head smokin'
I tried to act like I don't notice
Emotions, emotions, emotions, lord

I'm facing the bottle for all of my problems
These Instagram models are nothing but trouble
She's going away now (Now it's over)
I'm going full throttle (You drive me crazy)
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble

I had to leave that ho alone and get my mind right
I had to go talk to my friends, I had to find Christ
Lord I had to, open up my eyes and find light
I was so green and all she wanted was that limelight
Lord I, was so blinded by her highlights
She had me not checking my DM's neither my likes
Oh what, you modeling ma? Knock yourself out
Open my heart to you when you lock yourself out
When I met her she was posse'd up
In the section holding bottles up
Oh, she just wanted to be popular
Oh, she just want ten thousand followers

I should have known from the very start
That you weren't after my foolish heart
No, you liar, liar, liar girl
You got the world thinking you're a star
But Oh, you're not who you say you are
I'm dying, dying, dying, girl

I'm facing the bottle
(I'm sipping and lighted and dipping in line, but I'm coping)
For all of my problems (I'm too open)
These Instagram models (Glad I left her)
Are nothing but trouble (But I don't know her Lord)
She's going away now (Now it's over)
I'm going full throttle (You drive me crazy)
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble

President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as God as my witness
Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my Uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pot to piss in
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em
Uh, I'm a monster, exorcisms
Tote tools like mechanics, mechanisms
Uh, detrimental on any instrumental
I say you rappers sweet I pay the incidentals
I'm beneficial, I've been official
I say you rappers sweet, tiramisu
I like my short cake shorter
Ain't no motherfucker harder than

Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take chances
Your family tree, I will break branches
Cause I don't give a fuck, I put the ass in assassin
Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes
The future is born, put the past in the casket
If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard
Uh, appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then another plate after
Uh, yesterday just died
Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives
When shit get deep I'm never afraid to dive
Let the money pile up until I'm buried alive
Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell
Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale
Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses


Ya dead to me, brown grass nigga
I just stand still and let the ground pass nigga
Bullshit for lunch, brown bag nigga
Reality’s a bitch and I'mma dance with her
140 pounds, 5'6 from the ground
Bitch I'm in the building you ain't even in the lounge
I tried to fuck the world and couldn't even get aroused
I ain't looking for the beef but I ain't seen it in a while
Uh, and we all want world peace
Murder show, I give your ass good seats
Shit, I'm much more than a good speech

Gorillas in suits
The holy war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They shoot missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought drugs were killing the youth, *chuckles*
Thank you, thank you all, I am President Carter

My niggas been stuntin' since way back when
CNN, I got news for you haters
I'm a nasty ass nigga, ask your bitch, I ain't lying
69, that's a favor for a favor

Them hoes bitin' they lip, cause when I say shit like that she feel some type of way
I hit it from the front, from the side, from the back, I hit it all type of ways
She throw it at me like I'm just one strike away
Sometimes life is hard to swallow, but she like to taste
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding my lawyer fight the case
I got them flowers in me, I feel like a vase
Monsters in my closet no more closet space
Niggas want to be this fly, too many flights to take

Enough with the small talk, my girl pussy is a water-park
Every little thing I do turn her on; that's autostart
I kiss every single body part, her body is a work of art
I'm way too high, her skirt too short, I think I love her, it was just a thought
I pop up in that coupe 'bout to go back to the future
And she said, "Tune, not in my mouth," damn you should've said it sooner
I be shittin' on these niggas, like I'm sippin' Metamucil
And we smokin' on that gas, pass it like "excuse you"
And it's 6-6-2's Piru all day, my nigga
Before these niggas play with us, they'll play dead, my nigga
And if you lookin' for me, I'll be on these bitches' mind
These niggas chicken and I've never seen a chicken fly
My bitch been fussin' at me about nothin'
Ain't no tellin' what she'd do if I replace her
Like bae, I'm straight, there's plenty fish and I'm bait
We can't even have a decent conversation

I pop the seal on my sip and she be like, "See, you gon' drink your life away"
Bitch it's my life, my life, my life shout out Mary J
And tell them boys that beef tastes like a slice of cake
And old folks get shot too, they write down license plates
I hope that ho don't call sayin' her cycle late
All this fucking gotta stop, but I need tighter brakes
And don't run from this dick girl, I don't like to chase
I wax that ass, she make that Mr. Miyagi face
And she ain't all that pretty, but I like her shape
They say numbers don't lie, she shaped like a 8
She say she ain't no dyke, but she gon' dyke today
It's curtains for these niggas I feel like some drapes.
We turnt up niggas, burnt up, stop the microwave
This shit might cost us our life, but that's the price we pay
I'm hotter than the peppers Peter Piper ate
This that Dedication 5, whattup 5?

Ay Tune' I gotta turn up on the D5 man!

You know me dog, so watch what you say (You better watch your mouth!)
We ain't playing no games with your lame ass nigga, fuckboy you can die today (I swear you can!)

Fuck it, I'll hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched
You feel like Ruby Dee to me, great and powerful Ossie
Who's behind the man behind the curtain? Foxy
Coffee, brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin', oh wait it wasn't
Oh and I forgot I'll take a microwave or oven
So we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin
Maybe bake a dozen, my homeboy like your sister
Maybe they can bake some cousins, ooh isn't that sweet
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass

This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song

This is not a love song, this is a you song

Give you the world if it was for me
My diamond grill make it hard to see, I'm lying through my teeth
And now I'm flying on my PJ, looking at the clouds
Thinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile
I get mental flashbacks of your ass crack, lemme get back on track
You say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act
But anyway, we can role-play or get straight to it
Sorry, my mind in the gutter, better yet, sewer
And when you say I love you, I stutter, "I-I love you too"
It's Wayne's world, she say, "What is this world coming to?"
And she know me and whoever together, she hope we comin' loose
She told me that if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce
I laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other
Then she got serious and said, "Tune I gotta ask you something
Do you really love me?" I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like
"What if you and I were just letters?
That'd be unfortunate we'd have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket
Okay, that's a dead subject, you bring it up, that's a zombie
You remind me of, my memory ain't what it used to be"
She said she ain't trippin', I know, because I move my feet
And when she figure out that she been swindled
I'll be cleaning that love bird shit off of my window
I-I love you too...

This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you


I mean how many times
How many times I gotta
How many times I gotta say it for it to count?
Are you counting?

Sleeping at the top, nightmares of the bottom
Everybody wanna be fly until you swat ‘em
But who am I to talk? I ain’t shitting roses
We in the same picture, but we all got different poses
I’m looking in my rearview, I see the world in it
I try to slow down and I get rear-ended
Pause! Like a red light, I’m dead right
Highway to Heaven, God, do you see my headlights?
They say you don’t know what you’re doing 'til you stop doing it
Well, call me clueless 'cause I do this
Attention all shooters, I’m a shooting star

I’m searching for today, instead I found tomorrow
And I put that shit right back, like I’ll see what I find tomorrow
Young Money, CMR
Blood like a scar
Weezy F Baby, and the 'F' ain't for flaw

It's like I have it all, but I don't have to worry
Married to the money, a true love story
Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
Nothing standing in my way like nothing my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me

Okay, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point
Yeah the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice
I'm a gangsta by choice, I hope my sons choose wiser
And don't call me "Sir", call me "Survivor"

Uh, call me killer cause I make a killing

That's them twin Glocks, you can call them siblings
And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribblin
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly, like tinkerbell
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
I let them be, cause you know how the sting’ll feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track, train derail
Know how to roll, never need training wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, all or nothing, or nothing else
I bleed reality, I should cut myself
Just had a bowl of riches and a cup of wealth
And the 'F' is for "fuck yourself"

And I ain’t doing nothing but getting my share, breathing this air
And Mack’s mom told me she gon' keep me in her prayers
So I’m feeling alright, I’m trying to stay aware
And if you want to trip, then I'mma meet you there
To my niggas in the game, keep the game fair
Players play, coaches coach, and cheerleaders cheer
I’m trying to keep spirit when the ghost disappear
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' ain’t for fear

Swimmin' laps around a bottle of Louis the XIII
Jumping off of a mountain into a sea of Codeine

And if I should ever fall, the ground will then turn to wine
Pop (pop), pop (pop)
I feel like flying, then I feel like frying
Then (I feel like dying)

Only once the drugs are done
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying
Only once the drugs are done
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying


Psst! I can mingle with the stars, and throw a party on Mars
I am a prisoner locked up behind Xanax bars
I have just boarded a plane without a pilot
And violets are blue, roses are red
Daisies are yellow, the flowers are dead
I wish I could give you this feeling
I feel like buying
And if my dealer don't have no more
Then (I feel like dying)

Only once the drugs are done
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying
Only once the drugs are done
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying

Have sex on my jet ski, text my chef, told 'em "Let's beef"
Changing girls, change is fine

I am her feathers
She's fly, flyer than you
Flyer than me
I love her, she loves me too
I love her three –
Times more than her mom
Time will tell that I'm the nigga that
She should
We should
Be wherever she wanna be
On a late night, midday, AM
Just say when
And I know I be with cavemen
But nevermind them
She's Poison and I am Michael Bivins
See I know that y'all don't hear me
But she does
We does
What grown folk do
When they had too much to drink, and I think
We done had to much too drink, and

Oh yes I love her like; Pussy, Money, Weed
Pussy, Money, Weed; Pussy, Money, Weed

Oh yes, I love her like I oughta
I see you at the altar
Mrs. Carter
I see you with my daughter
Or son
More than one
Maybe Five, like the Jacksons
Or John Paxson
Just don't let em fuck up the mansion
And daddy will be home
Later on
Smellin' like the cologne
That I put on
This morn
And I hope
That you smell like woman's soap
And shampoo, and lotion, and perfume, and candles
And I'mma run through that pussy like a vandal
Yes, I'm nasty as a Scorpio, but I'm a lucky Libra
Got her wet like she's sweatin' out a fever
Wow
Leave her
To me and she'll be smiling
Every single time you see her
From ear-to-ear
I want to be beside her when she sleep as she lay
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day
Clothes are overrated
Panties are debated
Einstein; her head is the greatest

Oh yes I love her like her dad told her
No man
Would ever love her
Oh, and
I better be the only man
Stickin' it
Lickin' it like an envelope
Mailin' it, sealin' it, read it
I have written down Victoria's Secret
Don't tell nobody
Don't share your body with nobody
Not even a finger
I will cut it off and let him keep it
That ass for Weezy, baby
And at my station
We have sex orientation
When I hit it she squint like them Orient Asians
I do me
I say, "Hey Ms. Chun Li, I like to see your booty
Roll, like sushi"
I'm tryna dip my celery up in her bleu cheese
"Ahs", "Ooh-wees"
"Voilas", "Tah-das"
"Mhmms", "Uhh-huhs"
"Oh-yeahs", never "Oh-nos"
Until I have to go
And then it's: "Never! Oh, no"
I tell her, "Don't cry
I be back like the electric bill"
And when she's butt-naked, she's dressed to kill

When this shit dropped I was like 16
Tryna get some head from a mixed thing - big dreams
Say goodbye to ripped jeans, nigga got a job
Had my little wad, worst fear was getting robbed
For my last 50 dollars that I had left over
5 dollars and they pop a nigga in his left shoulder
Minimum wage, $5.15
13′s on the whip, kept my shit clean
Actually that was my mama shit
But I’m driving round town on my Obama shit
Middle-class my ass, just to get a tank of gas
Had to run the guns up the street and pawn the shit
But yeah, I’m headed for a scholarship
Little scrap game, but I got a lot of lip
Thats why them niggas don’t like me and always wanna fight me
A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth, most likely
I know the game, I’m an expert
Nigga, how you gonna jump me if my legs work?
Nigga I’m gone, showed up at the crib tryna bone
And I ain't fuck yet cause her momma always home
God damn, Lord have mercy
Please God don’t let this little broad have herpes
My nigga say she fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Gold medals if we gave hoes medals
No rose petals on a bed in the ghettos
Spiderman sheets, got her singing falsetto
Tall white tee’s, can’t believe we used to wear those
White folks looking at us like we’re weirdos
But we was only kiddos
Grabbing titties in the club, pocket full of skittle
Tryna get the kitty was like tryna solve a riddle
Tryna get to Diddy, cause I murder instrumentals
This that good old fashioned Mark Jackson
Fucked then I’ll pass, y’all Utah Jazz-in'
And ya’ll borin’, I don’t play nigga, I’m Mark Madsen
Thats why my knots thick like a fucking Kardashian
I’m not asking my nigga I don’t need favors
I’m in the streets with the fiends, I done seen danger
My team major, we party like teenagers
I’m in the green Range, nigga I’m the Green Ranger
(I fucking ran outta breath)
Team major, we party like teenagers
I’m in the green Range, nigga I’m the Green Ranger

Bitch I’m not old news, I’m more like gold shoes
She eat my whole dick, she like Whole Foods
They say I’m old school, but I dropped out
Drop ya body off at a cops house
They throwing up them bricks, you better box out
My niggas got enough white to build Barack house
I got my drawers on, Sam Rothstein
.44 on my waist, Rick Ross jeans
I’ve been faded, stone wash jeans
New pussy, new money, New Orleans
50 up in that uzi, G-G-G, G-Unit

I’m from the N-O, stretch niggas out like limo’s
Uzi go zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit, that's pimples
I’m bout to go banana puddin’
You a dyke cause your man a pussy
Hit you from the blindside, no Sandra Bullock
Never bite the hand that feeds you
Always watch the hand that’s cooking
Tunechi, D4 Ho

Shout out Cole
You already know what it is, Cole World
Wayne’s World

Uh, I'm flying private through Cloud 9
Yeah, if you got a problem, I'm Einstein
Yeah, I'm yawnin', I'm so tired of ballin'
Yeah, only selling work to them workaholics
Got guns bigger than you nigga, I don't fuck with new niggas
I blues your bitch ass, hope somebody give you rhythm
I got animal all in my floor, take your shoes off at the door
Niggas feed these bitches lies, nigga don't food poison my ho
I buy my drugs for the low, like a coupon on at the store
My niggas like Kanye with that good, my niggas like Lou Rawls with that blow
Niggas be sayin' they racked up, don't let that Q-ball leave you broke
I know you want a pat on the back, but then those fools goin' see you choke
I saw your bitch and she said, she tryin' to move on and let go
Boy, I get up in that pussy and hit her with moves you don't even know
Niggas be trippin' over these hoes, I done came too far to get close
I've been outchea gettin' bread and I don't need you all in my loaf
If you stick your neck out there, I'll have my goon's all at your throat
Niggas be lukewarm at the most and when I'm through ballin' I coach
Shout out to my nigga Mack gettin' his boo on in that Ghost
I'm still coming off the top of the dome but it'd be on a tombstone if I wrote, Tunechi

My kids already rich and they don't even know
These nigga's sayin' they playa's, they ain't even scored
My bitch rolling my weed, she don't even smoke
Everybody following me, I ain't even Moses, nigga

Uh, my cologne illegal in nine countries
I found a way like it was hiding from me
Yeah, my weed good, my sex better
Bitch, don't text me no long letters
I'm ahead of the game, I need a blowjob
Most of these ho's ain't got no job
And these niggas goin' buy em' everything
You goin' fuck around, and get the ho robbed
I'm ahead of the game, I need a haircut
Used to hug the block, I mean bear hug
And tell them rats the AK go Rat-a-Tat, like snare drums
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard, dick harder than a armadillo
MLK would be proud of me, cause I do this shit for all my niggas
Her mouth, pussy, or asshole, life is full of hard decisions
If she ain't fuckin', she get the boot, let me write this bitch a parking ticket
Ain't got time for love life, all I know is get paid
I'm high like Bonjour, twisted like french braids
I got my own shoes, SLIME, T, I feel like MJ
I'm working that graveyard shift, man these niggas been dead

Uh, I feel asleep in that pussy and I didn't even know
I woke up and acted like I didn't even know her, yeah
Don't fuck with these fuck niggas, you already know us
I'm looking for that loud pack, weedman bring the noise
Yeah

Pass that weed to the next nigga, blunt longer than a tongue twista
Hoes want this scud missile, I'mma ball, like Crystal
Lil Tunchi Li, young sex pistol, new money, no wrinkles
I'm hard headed, Ocho, Dedication Cinco, uh

You can get it tonight ho, and all night ho
I got the beat from (Maestro), fuckin' right, ho!

I might go crazy on these niggas, I don't give a motherfuck
Run up in a nigga house and shoot his grandmother up
What! What! I don't give a motherfuck
Get ya baby kidnapped and ya baby-mother fucked
It's tha Carter 3, bitch, better put your supper up
Hollygrove, I throw it up like I'm trying to lose my gut
Fuck is up? Beat him up like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffled up for the fuck of it, shit
Get on my level, you can't get on my level
You gon' need a space shuttle or a ladder that's forever
However, I'm better, if not now, then never
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you 'bout to suck my dick
Bitch, swallow my words, taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me
Two more inches, I'd have been in that casket
According to the doctor, I could've died in traffic
Bounce right back on them bitches, like Magic
Abracadabra, I'm up, like Viagra
I just do this shit for my clique, like Adam Sandler
I control hip-hop and I'mma keep it on my channel
Watch me, bitch, watch me
Bitch, watch me, but they cannot-see me, like Hitler
It's the New Orleans nightmare
Money so old, it's growing white hair
Young Money, baby, yeah we right here
I'ma make sure we ball 'til we fall like tears
And mama, don't cry, your son can handle his
I got her out the hood and put her in the hills
Yeah, when I was 14, I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough, I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was 14, I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I said
I told my girl "When you fuck me, better fuck me good
Cause if another girl could, she gonna fuck me good"
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it
And I get straight to it like it's nothing to it
Yeah, I got game like Stuart
Scott, fresh out the ESPN shop
And when SportsCenter poppin', everything stoppin'
But you can't fool me, I know what you watchin'

Me! You watch me! You watch me! Cause I be
Weezy, must see, T.V., C3
Nigga that's me, and I'm me, I'm me, times three
So retreat or suffer defeat, I'm back, 3-peat
C3!

I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker

I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking 'bout abortion

I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli
He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill nigga"
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on I Don't Give a Fuck Avenue

Down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Smoking on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared

And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a roller coaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there

I ain't nervous
I swear to God I ain't nervous, nah, nah
And I'm laughing at them pussy niggas
And that pussy shit they doin'
I'm getting cake like I'm Jewish
My nigga Drake he Jewish

Okay I swear to God I ain't nervous

I got her workin, twerkin and slurping my serpent
Ain't got no problems in this bitch, for certain
I see you turnin up but your turn up ain't workin
Just want some mouth and lip service
And I got all my niggas in that truck like an Excursion

Okay I'm straight at you, no ricochet
That pussy boneless, that's Chick-fil-a
I fuck with real riders and they tickets paid
For them dead presidents, we will start digging graves
I swear my momma trust my work
So I give these hoes that work
They say the best things in life are free
That's why it cost for you to get murked
And my pants sagging like fuck it - I'm still on my business
Spent my birthday in jail, I was making bad decisions
Saw my enemy at the light, shot him up before it turned green
Mane my niggas got them birds, you ain't even got bird seeds
Your bitch ride me like a go kart, I play that pussy like Mozart
I Mozart these hoes hearts then after that they worthless

Man, I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
I said I swear to God I ain't nervous
I don't know, I swear to God I ain't nervous
And that pussy don't get purchased, ho
Ain't got no problems in this bitch for certain
I see you turnin up but your turn up ain't working
I like em long haired and curvy
And if niggas think it's a game
I'll leave they brains on their jerseys

She say she love me, that's the molly talking
She about to blow me, like a signing bonus
She got a nigga but he ain't me bitch
I'm the original gangster, he the remix
Girl, do you use that same mouth to kiss yo momma?
I say, only God can judge me, fuck your honor
And her birthday suit is her pajamas
She say, I didn't know your dick was a recliner
I'll punch your man in his eye, give him a shiner
I'll blind him, him and whoever cosign him
I get Adam like Yolonda
Young Money Cash Money, Obama
It's fuck the world, no condom
If he twisted, I'll unwind him
And this pistol came with a silence

But I swear to God he heard it, yeah
And I swear to God I ain't nervous, nah
I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
Bitch I'm the God, I should be rapping in a turban
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
I see you turning up but your turn up ain't working
Baby, I just want some mouth and lip service
She gone ride this dick like the Kentucky Derby

On that Pat-ron, I'm swerving, game tight like virgins
I got a bad bitch, she Persian, call her AK when she's squirting
You see the niggas I'm with, that boy Boo the shit
As long as I got a face, yo bitch got a place to sit
Yea, I'm wilding off them shroomies
Ain't got no worries like Tunechi
All my chicks be bougie
Wanna hold hands then watch movies
I be goddamned, make a nigga lose it
Ain't no talking- lets get to it
Real niggas winning, fake niggas losing
Bitch I'll leave that pussy with bruises

Girl, I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
I swear to God I ain't nervous
No, you know I swear to God I ain't nervous
I got her workin, twerkin and slurping, my serpent
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
You fuck with Tunechi, you'll end up a missing person
She got Lil Tunechi on her booty, in cursive
I'm getting head behind the Maybach curtains
Ya

You know I ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
They tell me don't get high and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing
My eyes get so wide as it rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it, if she steal it I'mma kill her
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillas
And fuck your hospital, Young Money, we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty, like c-y-philis
Self-made G, and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was the Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and a little intervention
And them birds don't fly without my permission
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons
See my World is Different, like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thang

And you know that I’m gon' ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
Don’t worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
‘Cause the sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I’m gonna be in it
The sky is the limit

Buck-ten in the coupe, and your bitch love it
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch, don't talk to me
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free
And I hate when a nigga say talk is cheap
'Cause I'm the type that let money talk for me
My flow is art, unique
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on a mind of a shark is "Eat"
By any means, and you just sardines
I got the 40 cal. tucked in my Prps
What do you expect? I'm from New Orleans
The majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brand new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it, it'll still be ours

And I'mma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
And I'mma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit, yeah the sky is the limit
And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit

And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting
On the living room sofa
(That's fucked up, haha)
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Mail it to your Moms with a dozen of roses
(Hah, now that's fucked up)
And I'm a G
And you ain't got to know the alphabets to see
I know my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of shit but I cannot forget the street

So you know that I'mma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Don't worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit

Because the sky is the limit, yeah the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit
They tell me don't get high and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing
'Cause the sky is the limit
Hands up in the air, because the sky is the limit
Can you see me up there? The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
If you don't remember nothing, man, the sky is the limit

I'm about to go, up up and away
Dick in your mouth, fuck what you say
You sweet as pie, a muffin or cake
Dick in her mouth, I'm fuckin' her face
Live for the night, sleep in the day
Get high as fuck, sleep it away
I am a dog, you sheep in the gate
Pussy, mmm, how sweet is the taste
Gun to your head, what you keep in the safe?
Weezy, bitch, I'm deeper than space
Floating away like a leaf on the lake
I'm gone, like delete and erase
Talk that shit, I walk that shit
Pills, weed, all that shit
If the bitch is bad, I'mma call that bitch
Get pussy, ass, all that shit
Umh, what they talking about?
I go hard, they soft as a couch
I'm running 'em in and walking 'em out
Cars so cold I parked in the house
Flows so raw, this beat is pregnant
Flow so tight, it's yeast infected
Kill 'em all when they least expect it
Money tall, Lisa Leslie
YMCMB connection
Rappers is what I eat for breakfast
Woman up in my sheets is sexy
If she ain't fucking, she can exit
Gun tucked in the waist, I'll bust in ya face
I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away

Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days

Ain't this a bitch
I just saw my bitch kiss a bitch
You're lucky I don't kill your ass
But you can still get pistol whipped
Sharper than a pencil tip
Bitch don't even fix your lip
40 cal' with the extended clip
Ain't gon' be no incident
Skinny jeans, red Vans
Skully on, money long
Her mouth is like my house
So I guess you can say I'm coming home
You're wyling out then we're riding out
Now your hiding out, honeycomb
I'm laughing to the bank
Like I just broke my fucking funny bone
What's really good five?
I'm over here smoking that really good fire
Eyes so low I look blind
But the stove on my waist cook fine
I be with niggas that took lives
And niggas that'll take it outside
And niggas that'll take it to your crib
Take the baby out the crib and rape housewives
I'm gon' get so wasted
They gon' have to carry me out this bitch
I took over this rap shit
These rappers are just my hostages
Let's cut to the chase, my bitch no habla ingles
But I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away

Up up and away, up up and away

All my shooters are courageous, and

Ain't a moment 'til I make it
It ain't a moment 'til I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately
All I've been doin' is celebratin'
Don't even know what I'm celebratin'
I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' nathin'
They got niggas catchin' cases, while we out here catchin' breaks
And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it
(Shoot it if I wave it)
Do yourself a favor, save yourself cause I can't save yah

Know you see me in that Rolls Royce, glass house, that nigga, hands down
No givin' up, no layin' down, all red, ant pile
My oldest son just turned five, I said "Lil nigga, you a man now"
Ride around with that strap out cause my Rolls Royce, glass house
I just got a text that said "Baby I just cashed out"
Whack weed get ashed out, put Persian rugs in the crack house
All y'all that lashed out, I'll come see what that's 'bout
But you don't need to call the fireman, to put a mothafuckin' match out
I can't remember my last drought, all my niggas' smashmouth
Got pure coke, brand new birds, we get 'em as soon as they hatch, slime
And you know the driveway too big when you ain't gotta back out
Paper chase like cat mouse, my nigga it

Ain't a moment 'till I make it

Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately
All I've been doin' is celebratin'
Don't even know what I'm celebratin'
I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' nathin'
They got niggas catchin' cases, while we out here catchin' breaks
And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it
Do yourself a favor, save yourself cause I can't save yah

Know you see me cause my roof all in my trunk

Niggas say they kings, they lyin', boy you talkin' to a card shark

Got these voices in my head screamin', can't believe they're not hoarse
Bitch I've been a beast since cartoon sheets
It's real on the field, I need new cleats, outgrew these
Catch you while you sleep, turn your sheets to maroon sheets
Them choppers turn your homeboys into amputees
And that's not a good look, momma was a chef, but daddy cooked the work
Said "I know it stank but it's good"
Look, we treat them triggers like repeat buttons
Leave it all out there, or leave nothin'
Like the world a crystal ball, I keep rubbin' it

Ain't a moment 'till I make it
It ain't a moment 'till I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately
All I've been doin' is celebratin'
I don't even know what I'm celebratin'
I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' nathin'
They got people catchin' cases, while we out here catchin' breaks
And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it
Do yourself a favor, save yourself cause I can't save yah

Can't nobody save yah

I'll kill a nigga right now
I'll put a nigga lights out
Then put his body in a ice box
With holes in his body like socks
These niggas softer than
These niggas softer than nylon
So keep my name out your mouth
I hope it taste like cayenne
Looking up at the skyline
I'm thinking to my fuckin' self
"You only live twice, slime"
And motherfuck you if you fight crime
I'm from a place with a high crime rate, like Iran
We put your ass on Nightline
I'm on the grass like a python
These niggas looking at me
These niggas looking at me sideways
That's because they on the sideline
But they never tried mine
Spittin' like I'm sippin' cyanide
While my bitch sip a Mai Tai
But she wine fine
And I'm so sorry
She say "Don't be sorry"
Woo
Then she say "Don't apologize for shit
Cause you the shit
And we know Tha Carter 5 the shit"
Woah
Woo

But this is that Sorry 4 The Wait, nigga
Glock 40 for them fake niggas
Throw a party everyday, nigga
That's an ordinary day, nigga
Bad bitch in mi casa

And I'm flyer than the highest-flying bird around this ho
Whats the word around this ho? You'll get served around this ho

And you see my sharks like they got some bait around here
Hey, you better stop the hate around there
Before Tommy, Mack, and Nina debate around there
Yeah, you see it in my face, I don’t care
Whole court hearing, trial, and the case around there

Everybody wanna be fly but don’t know where their wings at
Huh, had to pause for a minute

And my girls be half naked like Betty Boop be

You think I'm stuntin', but no, I'm just survivin'
And I’ve been here, but my soul is just arrivin'
Look up in the air, it's a crow, it's a robin
No Ceilings, full dose, I'm prescribin'
Medication free, and for meditation we
Smoke some better tastin' weed that you’ll ever taste or see
S-H-A-R-P, as a tack, hotter than

Riding through wherever with the hammer strapped, I ain't lying
I can do whatever if I'm planning that
So I got my guns, let's dance, like FannyPack

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do (that's all I can do mama)
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart (I hope you hear me)

Pain, since I've lost you, I'm lost too
Nigga feelin' like he at the bottom like a horse shoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to
Be prayin' for the day you come back to me, sayin' that you forgive me
Give me another chance, I'm needin' it like a kidney
I don't wanna advance, give me back her hands
Give me back her touch, I don't ask for much
But I fucked up, I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up
But everybody fuck up, now this other nigga lucked up
Tellin' me and my clique don't give a fuck
Cause um, we from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster .. BANG!

You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control (I see you hidin' it mama)
You got it down, and your well on your way to the top (keep doin' your thing)
But there is something that you forgot

You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love, right after the fights
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me you are the brightest star under sunlight
See take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl and you give me back my life
Give me back my girl and you give me back my life
See this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin' she'd be in my sight
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me, is what I mean to rap (what I mean to rap)

You've been hiding, (y'know) never letting it show
Always trying (I see you hidin' it mama)
To keep it under control (but I know you know)
You got it down (I know you do)
And your well on your way to the top
(but I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness shawty)

But I hope you haven't forgot about me
Up in the livin' room watchin' Sports Center
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver, you know they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma, you even went and got a teardrop like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me "Butta", I called you "Bae"
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazin' like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me, and let me say
Please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream, damn

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart

Put my face up in her pussy and my thumb in her ass
Make her do the jumpman, ayy
I put her face down in the pillow, 'bout to smother her ass
A fly yellow bone to me, I told her to come get a tan
Now she butter pecan
Oh, I got a Draco in the sofa, an Eggo in the toaster
A cradle in the chocha, the yayo doing yoga
And I wake up, smell the Folgers, I don't know how I woke up
'Cause I was in a coma, but now I'm in the moment
Wearing high socks on the front porch
Two cups with the mud flowin'
The plug ain't charge me nothin' for it
I cried tears of fuckin' joy
LVs on my luggage, boy
Don't ask me where I'm fuckin' goin'
I pull up with my skaters
Make 'em beat you with their fuckin' boards
Sharp shooters like pool sharks
Shoot you down in the Walmart
Shoot you down in the parkin' lot
Shoot you down in the food court
Hit your crib in the Steamboat
Then disappear on the speedboat
Act a jackass like Steve-O
Then disappear like Ne-Yo
Leave a red flag on your screen door
Leave a red flag around your queen's throat
Leave a blood stain on your mink floor
Like a red stain on clean snow
That money gang, 500 gang on that money train
And we walkin' around with bloody fangs
Playin' hunger games; mmm-yummy, man
And we storm the block, lightning and thunder came
When my youngest came, that's your mother's name
Hit the address, knockin' down picture frames and other things
Throwin' up Eastside like stomach pains
Sugarcane get took to Spain, a kilo fell and it shook the plane
A nigga screamed, the hoes wouldn't complain
I brought the AK with the knife, so the butcher came
And the Nina came, and her sister came
And what's her name, it’ll go Buka Bang
You don't even know where to put the blame, that's cold

I just fucked like five hoes in my mansion
Got 'em feelin' like they five star
Your hoes throwin' fits, my bitches patient
Man, I feel just like a doctor

Americans hate that I'm American
Medicine, I treat it like peppermints
Uh, I'm in the ocean getting shark pussy
Shoot you in your fucking mouth and make you talk to me
Sometimes, I need someone to talk to
'Cause I am not a human being, Part II
Getting paid, show money for walkthroughs
Letting all these hoes ride my dick, carpool
My bars passed the bar exam, no law school
Cash Money Army, veteran with my war wounds
Uh, whatcha man doing?
I pop his muthafucking top like a canned good
And all my niggas that I roll with are hella armed
And last night, I took a transformer
And had a dream that my dick turned to Megatron
But my girl was sleeping with Decepticons
Money talks, man and mine talks lecture-long
P-U-S-S-Y, my second home
I be grinding on them hoes like a half pipe
She say, "Tunechi, you the shit, you need your ass wiped"
I say, "Before you gas me up, check the gas price"
Then I make her take this dick, like advice
She seesaw it, she suck it and enjoy it
I stick it in her ass like some fucking steroids
Jose Canseco, make no mistake
Like a white boy wearing black paint, you're a fake ass nigga
Brake pads, nigga, wait, you ain't in my weight class, nigga
Looking for the mutherfucking man in the mirror
Running this shit like a faucet, Farrah
Barra-cuda, who the fuck you-uh?
I can make your bitch root for me like I grew her
Bodies in the sewer, tampons in manure
90 billion bitches on my stick like a skewer
That's swag, I'm a true Blood, bitch, no fangs
Been went pro, now I'm going propane
Bitch get off me, bitch get off me
I got her over here blowing me like coffee
Decaffeinated, hand me that paper like I graduated
And I get head while it's decapitated
Think it's a game? Nigga, come play
I'm with my killer B's, fuck bug spray
Yeah, Young Money so gangsta
I personally know strangers
It's so strange, but this girl named Dana like to go anal
Shoot him in his head, what's that? A no-brainer
Plain old nigga, but a break from the norm
I wear my heart on my sleeve, so don't be breaking my arm
I rather ring ya fucking neck before I ring the alarm
I dream to meet a serial killer that'll bring me along with him
I gotta hit 'em like redbones with long hair
Fuck with me, your ass is grass, get a lawn chair
I was fucking before my dick started growing hair
Bitches sweating me like John Mayer, or warm air
Man, nuts and bananas
You know how the tables turn, where are your table manners?
If you fake, put a egg in your shoe and scramble
No rubber, I just fucked this piano
Nigga

Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
President got 'em in the White House naked
Looked at the clock and it say 'Right now'
Get a pound, break it down, blow it like trial
Panatela Dutchie, wine in my tall glass
Young Money, baby, big shit, like a horse ass
Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back
Bugatti matte black, "Where they do that at?"
South Beach Miami, ho, I'm probably with Tammy To'
My life is a video and the women want they cameo
I just want them pantyhose, and I’m higher than Geronimo
And I got them tools, tell them boys it could get mechanical
Now pop that pussy like a .44
I turn you 'round and bend you over like a low-blow
It’s Young Money, baby, we the fucking greatest
We done put them other niggas on a hiatus
Beat your bitch with the pump if she deny data
'Cause I’ll serve anyone like a blind waiter
I make my girl cum first then I arrive later
I shake you pussies up, I'm a vibrator
Getting money like hell yeah
This shit's so good it don’t even smell bad
And you can tell Dad that I’m a Motherfucker
You niggas best not slip, Ice Road Truckers
Light pole barrel, chopper stupid long
New Orleans nigga, I get Super-dome
Loyal to the game, the game been good to me

Young Money lay 'em down like old folks
You coming with it? We coming for it
Plenty to go around, now watch the money orbit
Real shit, people; now just absorb it
I tried to pay attention, but y'all mad boring
And I got so much swag I need an ad for it
And I don’t like to brag so my bitches brag for me
Oh, she a good girl? I got her transforming
She give me hot head, I call it global warming
If we gon' do it, dog; let's do it now
I am more animal than the zoo allow
Put me in the wild, I’ll be there for a while
You niggas little league, call 'em Curaçao
Energizer money, it keep going

Who rebounding? Who gives a shit?
Fuck that, I got 27 years of this
Hit or miss, I hit your Missus
You are local news, I’m 60 Minutes
I hit the target, I hit the witness
I work out in my office, guess I’m fit for business
Too many visions, completed missions
Still icing out crosses, keep it Christian
We consistent, the streets commend it
Weezy F. Baby, the 'F' is for 'Forensics'
From start to finish, Usain Wayne
OK, you're doing your thang, well things change
You Plain Jane, I’m diverse
I save the world second, and I get high first
I’m a mind freak, check my time sheet
Bitch, I bring the noise, where the lions sleep
Your flow never wet, like Grandma pussy
I’m always good, like Grandma cookies
Yeah, call me the spleen or the spine fixer
It's going down like the Catalina Wine Mixer
She going down like the hands on my time-ticker
I’m always strapped; Vietnam, nigga
We are fine, nigga, like Amber Rose
We ball, nigga, like Jalen Rose
Better tell them hoes, I got a million flows

But for now I feel lovely, I feel great

No I ain't a player, I just play it by the bullshit
And I know what I'm doing
She loves how I do it, she throw that ass back and she never over-do it

Neither will heroes
Lord, they better hope you save him
Better catch the holy ghost

All they sell is pussy, cause they been sold they soul
Boy, you go zero to sixty, I go one-and-two-zero's
Pedal to the metal, I call it rose gold
Lord all I know is paper
Big fat money rolls
Look at how big my safe is
That bitch got double doors
I was runnin' outta patience
'Til I heard all aboard
They mad cause I be skatin'
At home on marble floors
Lord knows I drive fast in my driveway
I pop tags and throw 'em down and make the ground shake
Goddamn, a pint of lean almost 5k
I be spendin' 25k every 5 days
I sent my girl on a spa day
Cause Hood just came with them chickens

Give no fucks
Take no stuff
And take your stuff
Then ho hunt
For some chocha
I know a ho
Who'll rock the boat
But I row her
I'm Noah, Lord
I remember when I was no one, Lord
When I couldn't find jack in no one's cards
Ms. Cita
I remember goin' in your gun drawer
Puttin' it to my chest and missin' my heart by centimetres
Oh Lord
I remember dyin' on her room floor
And wakin' up in some police's arms
He died recent
So I hope heaven made more room for him
And I hope he see me
Cause if he didn't save that lil boy there would be no Weezy
Oh Lord

Twist made me do this

Kush and a Swisher
Money over bitches

She pretty like the bride of Frankenstein
She kill it like she married to the mob
I can't let one of these hoes lock me down mama
She said don't worry son I'll help you make bond
Cause these hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades
Don't let it blow up in your face now
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9
Diamonds in my teeth, I'm eating carrot cake
So hard for me to put on a fake smile
I had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9
I got cocaine, I got cigarettes
I don't do neither, it's at my bitch request
She like bad boys, I'm her crook in the neck
Her suicide note say she love me to death
Ooh, for her Lewinsky is so critical
And I didn't mean to get political
I watch her, let her figure slither
But I don't look into her snake eyes

Even though a nigga got it
Countin' all this money

I’m coming back out jumpin' like Jordan
I’m so sorry for the wait, I’m tardy
I wrote a letter to my competition
It started off with: Dearly Departed
Hippie, I be so trippy

I hope she ain’t strictly dickly
So we can menage to Nicki, ooh

Shawty badder than a three-year-old
Keep playing and I'mma eat her like a pita roll
I'm just saying, with my love I could feed her soul
Two-day getaway and we don't need our clothes
We at the pool and she looking like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she getting plenty mo
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other women hoes
You send her rose, I pick her flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear then lick round her lobe
And when she check her watch, it’s never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came she caught me like a common cold

Damn you the shit
And I’ll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I dont really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit
With you baby, with you and only you

I say damn I must be left
Cause you the best I ever seen, right
Shawty put me on, you got me going like some green lights
See you with your girls, they probably telling you that he ain't right
Bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice
Let's get together over night
Shawty I'm a pro and you are looking like the prototype
Ms. Cita, I took your advice
Sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice
I'm cruising on the road of life but I need a passenger
Appetite for loving, ma I'm hungry like a scavenger
I be on that lavender
I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner

Damn you the shit
And I’ll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I dont really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit
With you baby, with you and only you

Now she don't know about me but I'mma put her on it
And she ain't sure about me but can't go without me
We probably ain't supposed to be together
But I wonder if our love affair could last forever
And shawty I'm with you
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget you
Then I told her to her face
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place

Damn you the shit
And I’ll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I dont really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit
With you baby, with you and only you

Yeah, when I step in the spot, motherfuckers say "who that?"
Big Bun B, but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin' on the trill OG, where they do that? (for real!)
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix man, just go' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand, with no easy fix, man
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar, and hoes in the crib
Drank, and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with PA so you know what it is
I'm sittin on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
And we do it for the pimps no holding back, let's go!

Look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB till the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like Kanye West and Em
Track record, goes back to the Essence
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man's intestines
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
Gut 'em like a gastric bypass
But ya Nas advocates actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon
Fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs
That'll bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight that my crown ain't for testin', testin'
Chop heads off like King Henry VIII
Guillotine to ya neck bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin' dude
Studied taoism and made power moves
Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
There go my nigga Wayne
Let them niggas hate or like my nigga Drake say
"We ain't got time to respond to niggas"

I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta, when I pop up with them poppers burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa, Blood gang, five
It’s that Blood gang five, but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain’t gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain’t gon' fight
They actin' like they ain’t gon' die until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed-do-or-die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it’s no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it’s the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!

They say I’m underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That’s when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin' “there he goes again!"
See now they nominated a nigga to come and
Flatten everything now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain’t no fakin’, ain’t no kind of mistakin' how I be breakin'
Up everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I’m done (DAMN!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I’m out the door
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with tha Carter IV

09, we tote; my niggas ain't no joke
And we keep them blows, so please don't get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked

I'm rollin', all my niggas rollin'
Keep that fucking red bandana: Hulk Hogan
I'm cuttin' up like scissors, coming down hard like blizzards
I'm gettin head while givin' head, that's a head-on collision
I'm on a pain pill, I keep this shit trill
These niggas ain't for real, like a fire drill
Yo ho on my back like a fuckin' fifth wheel
That bitch make her pussy open and close like fish gils
I put all my niggas on, but some of those niggas gone
Them niggas callin' my phone, leave me alone
I'm lightin' up that strong, then pass it to my bro
Numbers don't lie: except 5-0
Different colored TruckFit shirts, you niggas put on yo skirts
If I die off these percs, put a bad bitch in my hearse
My hoes lift up they shirts, I'm high as Captain Kirk
If we run out of work, we Rob, like Bert
Yeeeeaaaaaaaah Niggaaaa!

Corlay RIP him, Darnell RIP him
If you disrespect them, then you gone meet them
My niggas rollin 4-seata; that bitch going, she a eater
She was a good girl, I turned her to a eater
Hit squad move burbons, young nigga on freeband
.30 clip and them hollow tips make him do the running man
That Glock 40 I’m thumpin man; I'm rolling with my hitters
I'll send my hitters out to go get you
Hella bands, hella bands, hit the club throwing hella bands
Heavy load, throwing hella bands, in the club doing the money dance
Hella bands, hella bands, hit the club throwing hella bands
Heavy load, throwing hella bands, in the club doing the money dance
Niggas talking shit in the club, he better watch his self
Melly got the .30 on his hip, he gone need some help
I'm a gangster, nigga, and I could do this shit my fucking self
Pistol to his melon; (and what else?) it ain't gone be nothing left

Running round with my gangstas, running up on these yellow hoes
Everybody wanna fuck my bitch, her pussy lips like heaven doors
It's pussy, money, and kush, skateboards and shroom
These niggas think they the shit, these niggas perfume
Hollygrove, so Hollygrove, all I know is Hollygrove
I'm sick with it, I've been diagnosed
We don't cut the coke, that's Diet Coke
These niggas broke, I'm paid in full
Blood gang, Red Bull
My tongue like a surfboard, and her pussy like a wave pool
Tunechi

"Pyong" on the Yamaha, chromed out 11 hundred
What I'm doing? Getting money. What we doing? Getting money
What they doing? Hating on me, but they never cross
Cash Money still the company and bitch I'm the boss
And I be stuntin' like my daddy, stuntin' like my daddy
Stuntin' like my daddy, I be stuntin' like my daddy
I'm the Young Stunna, stuntin' like my daddy
Stuntin' like my daddy, I be stuntin' like my daddy

Shorty, 98's, 45 paper plates
Tint the whole thang, big money heavyweight
A hundred stacks, spend 50 on a Caddy, 25 on the pinky
Bought a pound of blow and bounced back
Matching grills, big houses on the hill
Got them hoes in the kitchen all cooking, paying bills
I start to holler, dollar after dollar
Flipping chickens, getting tickets. Want the money and the power
Born Stunna, Uptown hunter
3rd ward G, nigga, been about money
Ice chunky, Birdman, red monkeys
White Tees on the chromed-out 11 hundreds
You know we shine every summer, we grind every summer
And this is how we spend money
You see them Bentleys and them Lambs'
Them ounces and them grams, bitch we was born hustlas

"Pyong" on the Yamaha, chromed out 11 hundred

Yeah when I was 16 I bought my first Mercedes Benz
I must've fucked a thousand bitches and they girlfriends
White leather, hot new bare rims
Brand new pistol with a trigger like a hair pin
Big work, we don't need a scale man!
Big papers: say "good morning" to the mailman
What you know about putting bricks in the spare, man?
I can stuff a coupe like a motherfuckin' caravan
I'm in my zone, my form is so rare, man
If there's a throne, you looking at the chairman
How you want it, show me my opponent
*Munching noises*
Show me my opponent
I'm still ballin', a bullet gotta get me
And I've never been a pussy cause my hood never let me
A made nigga, got made niggas with me
I'm a motorcycle boy, so I'm about to park the Bentley

Man all you pussy niggas drive me crazy
Make me sick to my stomach, I feel nauseated
All you haters hold hands and jump off a building
I could still taste her pussy, memorabilia
Backpack full of artillery
One me, no equivalent
These niggas acting like lil bitches
I don’t understand this shit, Like you scribbled it
Took her clothes, step back and exhibit it
Then tear her ass up like a parking ticket
The end of the road is at walking distance
Have to get that blood off my hands, left the faucet drippin
In yo face like a airbag in a car collision
My weed man so consistent
I’m stayin rich, tryin not to make poor decisions
Everything I do I plan it out like a solar system
Nigga if you clumsy you gon slip and fall a victim to me
Your bitch is sendin' naked pictures to me
Then she shoot over to my house, I scoot over in a bed
I shoot off in her mouth then she bit the bullet uh
Skatin on em like I’m Lil Wayne
And the weed so strong I can feel veins
Write it down, take a picture, now I feel framed
The drugs got me so numb I can’t feel ashamed
And my girl at home with the mood swings
Girl I gotta make a few runs like Usain
Wish I had a penny for my thoughts for some loose change
Hungry niggas going at yo neck for that food chain
Drop some pills that make me sleepy
Hoes creep me in they Teepee
I hope that pussy taste like kiwi
Hope it’s nicer than Tahiti, hopin I could get a freebie
Leavin a nigga body floatin with a mouth full of seaweed
What's in my Louis backpack, that’s E.T
Snitches give me the heebeegeebees
I hope they’ll disappear, where the fuck is Houdini?
I got niggas on my side, you got niggas on yo back
I’mma yell timber, money grow on trees
Money over queens, fuck you blow me
I sit back enjoy the breeze, hoes prettier than please
I don’t really do shit but sit back and call the shots
She poured out her heart, I had it on the rocks
Red beam on yo head, that’s a cherry on top
You don’t wanna keep your cool, I know niggas that’ll die uh
I danced with the devil in my dreams
When I wake up I still hear the same song
Make me wanna blow a motherfucker brains out
Flood warning nigga, I’m about to brainstorm, lil nigga
I’ll take yo main ho, make her call her homegirl
Make em share the same dick

R.I.P. baby, my phone died, but don't cry
Heaven's gates was closed, I went to Hell, there was a long line
Two hoes in the bed, it's hard to wake up on the wrong side

Few bumps in the road, a little bump and grind I don't mind
Please know, for your fuckin' piggy bank you could get hog tied
Two Ninas on me, you fuck with me, them girls goin' wild
Guilty conscience pimpin', make my ho sit through the whole trial
I been walkin' on this fuckin' water for a long time
Molly water got me transformin' like I'm Voltron
Smokin' so much weed, I might just fuck around and hug a tree
A tree without a bird 'cause I deserve every fuckin' leaf

1, 2, 3; triple-OG
At the T-O-P smokin' P-O-T
From a D-O-G to the G-O-D
Got OCD and not your CD
Hit her with the D-O-P-E D
That's Dope Dick Tunechi, DDT
You could D-I-E for a F-E-E
I'll D-I-E for my S-E-T
I told my son that "Whatever the sun touch is yours, little nigga"
I told my daughter, "Don't give up your love to a poor little nigga"
I told my bitch if she cheat then she making a poor decision
I told that bitch if she leave then she leavin' the solar system
But hoes don't listen
But I'm on the road to riches, and she can't ignore the engine
I bought myself a medallion that cost an Azure, my nigga
I don't know, guess I was bored, my nigga
Tell foreign hoes "I'm El Señor", my nigga
To the Moon like Warren, nigga
He ain't the plug unless he foreign, nigga
It ain't a car unless it's foreign, nigga
And a R plus another R, my nigga
But I used to want a Ford Explorer, nigga
Had to move the trap house to Florida, nigga
Had to move the car to by the water, nigga
But I'm still too scared to get in the water, nigga
'Bout to throw another pool party, nigga
I told a op that wherever this gun point is hoes, lil nigga
Stayin' on my feet, no tappin' on my toes, like Moses, nigga
I told the cops that my car is too fast to pull over, nigga
Cool as fuck, keepin' my cool before my composure, nigga
That's poker, nigga
Playin' the cards I was dealt, and that shit almost broke a nigga
But I could be broker, nigga
But I’m watching Oprah, nigga
In my white house layin' on my sofa, keepin' it soulful, nigga
I'm a young mogul, nigga
I'm a young Hova, nigga
My office is oval, nigga

I step out that bitch like, "What's happenin'?"
Me and that little bitch I was nappin' in
Time to run with no rubber, I'm gamblin'
Just call me the rapper, I'm Chancin' it
Got a sassy bitch, told her "I'm daddy, bitch"
Does it look like I'm playin'? Kaepernick
Niggas don't know a star from an asterisk
This that new coffin, new casket shit
My killers killin' on purpose by accident
And you felt that shit like a laxative
Ain't where or why you trap, it's who you trappin' with
For me it's about who I travel with
Never about the bitch that I be snappin' on
It's the one that the picture just snapped me with
That's 'cause I'm the shit, and all of my shit be miraculous
E

Play me or play with me, then I'm gonna for your mother
Niggas wanna eat, 'cause they ain't ate nothin'
But niggas wanna leave when you say you out of mustard
So I'ma walk into the restaurant alone
Leaving out, leaving behind just residue and bones
In your residence with Rugers to your dome

Holding your throat, choke

See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward
She watch me take a shower, I asked her why she didn't join me
She said because you didn't ask me; I said, "Damn, I didn't think I had to"
Then she take off my towel, and I-I take off her blouse
I tell her that that pussy for me, just in case she thought it was ours
And she say cool

And if you like it I love it
If she like it I love it

See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Cause every time she try to tell me something, she open up her mouth, I stick my tongue in
She got a piercing in her vagina, a skirt with nothing under
And she say when she don't see me, she feels like Stevie Wonder

That's when I said, "Work, work, work
If you want that purse, skirt, shirt"
And she made me cum 100 times
She made me cum 100 times
Man, she got that work, work, work
I say you my bitch now, I'm calling you first
And then made her cum a 100 times
She kinda green but I'm color blind

Uh, I like that shit

Ooh, I like that shit
And she bite that lip don't fight that dick girl, girl
Fucking with you, well, I'ma need another shower

Then we gonna make each other shout

There's steam in the air, fog everywhere
She can get her hair wet cause it's her real hair
I be like, "Hell Yeah"
And she be like, "Fucking right"
Now she got one leg in the air, I'm pulling on her hair
And she say I can pull it, cause it's her real hair
She be like, "Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah" cause I fuck her right

Then I said, "See we ain't got much in common
So we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward"

I got old money, take a bath in hundreds
My way or the highway and I see traffic comin'
It's Tunechi in this ho, watch them hoes go crazy
Pass that weed around, like that shit contagious
And I got news for all these snitches, tell them feds stop bitching
If pussy lips could talk, I'd go down there like it's whisperin'
You know life is so uncertain and death is so unwanted
My navigation system say it's death around the corner
I got a condo for a stash house, a condo for a stash house
Get that boy a mirror, so he can watch his damn mouth
See I get it from Sosa, he got it from Frank
And Sosa alright, but I'm tryin' to meet Frank
He said business is well, he ain't got no complaints
You'll be Batman and I'll be robbin' the bank
I know I ain't gon' fall, even though I'm power trippin'
Glass house nigga, you see how I'm livin'
I know that we the new slaves, I know that we the new age
Ain't no such thing as too paid

Like it's freezing and you naked, shake that ass ho
Shake that ass ho

When we throw a pool party, we put sharks in the pool
I got Bloods in the cut, so don't throw salt in the wound
AK wet niggas up, I don't throw water balloons
Better call the platoon
If it's fuck it then fuck it, now you speakin' my language
Put your dead body under them white sheets with no blankets
I'm so rich I go pour
Champagne and don't drink it
Ice on my neck like I fainted
These are the thoughts of the brainless
No new friends, we don't talk to strangers
Man I'm so serious with this pimp shit
Full clip in my Mac 10
Ain't no exit out the game, nigga cut off your blinkers
And if she married I fuck her, if she lonely I fuck her
If she crazy I love her, y'all just don't understand her
She say you got it made, I say no I got a butler
They tell me to turn up, but I'm the knob on the oven
I got a knife in my pocket if there's a fork in the road
I'm the man of steel, but I won't say what I stole
Bring that coke to the stove, and whip it like a new slave
Whip it like a new slave

D5
Whattup five
Take that coke to the stove
And whip it like a new slave, whip it like a new slave
Like it's freezing and you naked shake that ass ho

Not only other regions, I really popped at the crib
So hatin' motherfuckers, you better stop with the jibs
Off of the thizz, but I'm boss
It don't matter what the cost when I live right across from the Wiz
Killa City will have a nigga lost in the Mid
Doing nothing but mothers stacking pussy coffin again
What is happening is a merger
Different levels of murder
Lil Weezy cook it and I'mma serve her
Further when I'mma get doing this - remember when eating Gerber
Mama said to kill 'em all, and I heard her
Thank you, Baby, for what became Lil Wayne
It's gettin' all the people knowin' that Strange in the game
I been really able to hang in the fame
But when he shouted my name it's been a change in my lane
I'm a Klusterfuk and lovin' nothin' but to get your brain
And I be stuck in lust and quick to a bust a nut
And take a nigga's dame with no shame
When they be bussing 'nough
They thinkin' they thuggin' tough
But never do knuckle up
You in the gang, you bang
You drunk and touching every thang, you lame
Sucka, you cannot sustain the reign
Tech N9ne is such a cuckoo in this
Baller nigga, Strange Music, crew threw swishes
I know a lot of you prolly never knew who this is
Well, you listenin' to Tecca Nina, Soo Woo business

Today, I feel electric gray, I hope tomorrow neon black

No car doors, whatcha call those?
A whole carload of raw hoes

Three’s assembled like nobody
He's a symbol of what's safari
Pulled her ponytail to my body
She’s the only girl that was smart E-
-nough to call me 'Mr. Benjamin' in the middle of a wild party
Skin was cinnamon; I pound it harder

Are the light ones?

Til I shoot you in the head, now she grossed out

This world is only preparation for the next (Alright)
Money bags under my eyes, money over rest
Tryna get a hunned M's out the alphabets
Open up my mouth to smile, ooh treasure chest
Ooh, DJ Stevie J keep the Glock on him

Fuck them bitchass niggas, fuck whoever care for 'em
Momma jumped out a plane, I was air-borne
Gold watches, gold chains; watch for Leprechauns
Favorite subject was PE, Pablo Escobar

Excuse my French, but it's menage a trois, au revoir

In a Lamborghini with the seats wet
Hardest lesson is regret
Snorting powder on the P jet

I love red bitches, there's just something 'bout 'em
But I'm gettin' better pussy from a brown one
Been schoolin' y'all niggas, I'm your alma mater

Fuck that shit you talk, I beat that pussy like production
Or like Rocky, beat the Russian, or like Jordan, beat the buzzer
Nigga, gimme what you've got, take that money like an usher
One man band, all you hear is repercussion
Told a bitch, too much selfish gonna lead to self destruction
She looked me in my eyes and said
Man, I ain't worried 'bout nothin', I said shorty, you a beast

I love bad bitches, okay, what's the problem
If she thinks she gonna come up then I'mma fuckin' drown her
I'm wilder than public schools and public housing
Can't afford failure, I'm just browsing

And if you talk trash I'mma fuckin' possum
And nigga, if your bitch got eye problem
You know what it is, armed robbery
Tunechi

I heard 'em tell me "Go get 'em, young"
I haven't seen a movie since I started livin' one
I be in a room full of bitches gettin' drunk
Smokin' like a point guard, no look, passin' blunts
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? Euro, this and that
Wanna walk in these shoes? Have the outfit to match
And niggas schemin' on what I had, but
We gon' put money in the bag or a body in the bag (You choose)
And all these new bitches old news
Throwin' stacks at 'em like "That's prolly gon' bruise"
And every dream girl that I fucked came true
Now every night feels like deja vu
And the hatin's no use, she ain't waitin' on you
I tell a baby, "Tell ya man kick rocks with no shoes"
And I murder that pussy, and I ain't leave a clue
Cause I put her on her knees and made her swallow all the proof
That sick shit, I'm ill, yeah, I'm a fuckin' problem
I'm fine wit' it, though, bitches like fuckin' problems
And I can't solve shit if I'm the fuckin' problem
Just know I got 'em, let me know if there's a fuckin' problem
Out the city, but you can't take the city out 'em
I know these hoes well, see the water spittin' out 'em?
Long story short, money always colorblind
She blew the team for some Red Bottoms

I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
Had a few ugly bitches but I had to hide em
Can't live with em, Can't live without em
Can't trust them hoes poking holes up in condoms
Put a S on her breast, she a supermodel
If you swallow these kids, does that make you childish
Now she say I got a fuckin problem
Because I fucked her once and gave a fuck about her
Her hair blown out like the 80s
I drive these bitches crazy, mental asylum should pay me
I ain't looking for a lady, call Will Smith to get you hitched
I ain't looking for a wife, I need a one night trick
That can ride it like that, suck it like this
Hit it from the back in the back of the whip
I'm a mac, I'm a pimp girl
You don't need make up, put this mac on your lips
She drive a X5, beefin' with her ex man
Baby Ima dog and a DMX fan
Told myself I wouldn't mess with my ex again
Popped a lil x then i tried explain

Lil Wayne tougher than John Wayne
Make him change his name to John Doe
It's me and my lil brother Capo
Lil Marly G and my bottom bitch
If I'm falling, it's bottomless
If I'm tripping, it's a power trip
Her pearl tongue like the pearly gates
And with that said, I climb the fence
My other bitches gotta ride the bench
And with that said... bitch you jealous

But I had to spread my wings
Ain't trying to get lemon-peppered
Got too many pistols, too many issues
Too many mistakes, too many miscues
Only made me better, it turned me into
The man I am today, I'm new and I'm improved
I got my shit right, it's just you and a tissue
Suit yourself because this suit is a rental
Now the snow is just coming in
Like I broke a window to an igloo
Slow a bitch down like "Un momento"
I'd rather get screwed than scrutinized
I'd rather get used by a cutie pie
If she ain't fucking it's Uber time
I'd rather be advised than supervised
You do the math, we do the numbers
We pour champagne and expensive wine
In water guns and shoot each other
I get high, meditate like a monk
Preposterous when I get drunk
And my goons is wilder than Gronk
My do's is as bad as my don'ts
Met a kinda-cute bitch with a donk
As long as the bitch got a donk
And I smell like; pussy, money, and weed
She say "Ooh, I like your cologne"
The last niggas tested us flunk
So please study hard, study long
Kill your wife, then take the bitch phone
And text you to please hurry home
And the rain drops turn into blood
Look like you just come in from a storm
And if all pussies come with walls
I hope you run into your own
Nigga
I come with that heroin flow
I come with that never before
My CMB days are dead
I ain't worried bout ghost
I married the MOB, we divorced
Hoo, and all that shit dead without me of course

You burnt yourself and was supposed to pass me the torch
Fuck it, I'll see you in Forbes, nigga

To me, bitch; I'm the alpha, the alpha D-O-G, bitch
S-R-Y for the W-A-I-T, bitch

So you've got so many diamonds
You wear all the finest clothes
And your grill is shining
As you're driving down the streets of gold
But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire!

Momma always told me I was crazy
And my hoes say I'm amazing but I don't listen to a lady
But the bitch say I'm hot, and I say "No bitch, I'm blazing"
Like, what the fuck you expect? I'm a motherfucking Cajun
I feel caged in my mind, it's like my flow doing time
I goes crazy inside, but when it comes out it's fine
Like wine; wait, watch...
See? I get better with time like a watch
Osh B'Gosh, Posh Spice husband
Couldn't kick it like I kick it, bitch, I Kix it
No cereal, like a landing, I sticks it
Wherever she asks me, after she licks it
That's too explicit, well why you listening?
I smell smoke, and something's sizzling
That's her pussy, so hey pussy, play with pussy or play pussy

But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire

They say you're nobody 'til somebody kills you
Well, where I'm from you're nobody 'til you kill somebody
And you know what they say, when you great
It's not murder, it's assassinate
So assassinate me, bitch
Cause I'm doing the same shit Martin Luther King did
Checking in the same hotel, in the same suite, bitch
Same balcony like "Assassinate me, bitch!"
It's Lil Tunechi
I don't rap, I film movies
With my rap, so you could call me
"Mr. Director's Chair," yeah, and that's a wrap
Cut! On to the next
Not the next scene, bitch, the next check
Some say the X makes the sex 'spect
So play with the pussy or play pussy

So you've got so many diamonds (Hey pussy)
You wear all the finest clothes
(Lay pussy, do what I, say pussy
And I say, I say, lay pussy)
And your grill is shining
(Lay pussy, lay pussy, haha, hey pussy)
As you're driving down the streets of gold
But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire!
(Hey pussy, don't play pussy
Get 'em!)

Straight off the corner of Apple and Eagle
Braveheart, bitch, like the times are medieval
Married to the game, divorced the cathedral
Standing on the corner selling porcelain to people
Forced into evil, it's all in your head
It's all so cerebral, call me Knievel
You follow and I lead you straight to the needles
The bottles, the battles, the beetles'll eat you
Momma named Cita, I love you Cita
'Member when your pussy second husband tried to beat ya?
'Member when I went into the kitchen, got the cleaver?
He ain't give a fuck, I ain't give a fuck neither
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
He could smell the ether, you can see Cita
You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features
And she don't play neither

But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire!

When this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us
Love only lasts if my heart races on
So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
I'm racing on, yea, on
I'm racing on, yea
My heart races on

I'm priceless
Remember me like they remember the Titans
Reality bit me, and continue to bite me
Got no degree, but where I'm from that’s the original climate
Where you can’t tell a fiend a crack rock isn’t a diamond
Hold on
Lord, if my Bugatti come to a dead-end
I've already been everywhere except heaven
And tomorrow’s not promised
When I'm gone but not forgotten
I hope my homies calming down my momma, Lord
I guess I'll see you on that other side
Where the flowers never die
The angels never lie
Yeah, the revolution will be televised
I just hope my contribution will be memorized
Lord, Momma hate I got my Daddy’s eyes
Never looked into my Daddy’s eyes
He ain't have the time
Fuck him
The revolution will be televised
I just hope my contribution will be memorized

When this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us (Hold on)
Love only lasts if my heart races on (Hold on)
So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster (Hold on)
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
I'm racing on, yea (I'm gone)
On (I'm gone)
I'm racing on, yea (I'm gone)
My heart races on

Tunechi, you an angel
Must be here for a reason, and that might be the main one
Fuck it, I'm making money before making changes
I sold my soul to the devil, he bought it, then exchanged it
Fuck it, I'm working bitch, I know you see me working
Searching for better days before a better person
I'm perfect
Just ask my bitch and she’ll say that so urgent
I purchase
My children gifts and I just keep the curses
Yeah
My heart right, and my head ain't
'Cause I'm never in my right mind
But I'm Einstein when I do think
And I grew wings
If you catch a feather, just keep it
And I’ll be racing on; no shortcuts, no cheating

When this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us (Hold on)
Love only lasts if my heart races on (Hold on)
So I step on the gas (Errrr)
Burning faster and faster (Hold on)
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
(My heart right and my head ain't)
I'm racing on, yea (I'm gone)
On (I'm gone)
I'm racing on, yea
(There’s nothing left but to fly high
If you catch a feather just keep it)
My heart races on

This morning I woke up on my good side
Life is just a race against time so have a good time
Heart racing, thoughts racing
Competition, goodbye
I turn around and run backwards
To see what second place look like
Oh Lord, what are we running from
The police, 'cause they already killed enough of us
Stay out them streets 'cause they don’t fuck with us
They hunting us
We in a race against racists, that’s a color run
I keep my feet above the ground
We gon' run the town
Heart racing on, beat-beat-beating, knock and pound
Love marathon, getting deeper by the mile
I see no finish line – On your mark, set, pow

Y'all don't want no problems up in here
These niggas wear dresses and y'all call me weird nigga?
Go in niggas' pockets while we here
What kind of cologne do you wear because all I could smell is fear nigga
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
Boy I'm from New Orleans where the dope fiends kill niggas
Brains came out his fucking ear
I got a full clip, I empty the whole thing up in here
Now I'mma keep a pill and a blunt
I might pass the motherfucker but most likely I'mma flunk
Tell my bitch I could do bad on my own
She say "You gon' miss me nigga." I say "Bitch the thrill is gone"
I ain't drove it look better in the driveway
Married to the MOB, man you niggas just some bridesmaids
Bitches give me head instead of playing mind games
Tattooed tears for my homies, it's a cryin' shame
You could get a Dom P bottle to your face
Niggas just construction workers, trynna build a case
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
Why your bitch blowing me up? If I answer, I deflate
Motherfucker I'm like
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
I fuck her 'til she cry, make that ho drink her fuckin' tears
Lord, I hope she swallow more than tears
Then her homegirl came in the room and volunteered
Man, dreads hanging out the ski mask
Run up in your house, the couch potatoes getting mashed
Run up in the kitchen get your stash out the oven
You wonder how we know? stop talking while you cuddlin'
Ain't nothing like some pussy when you going through something
Just called a bad bitch, I said I'm going through something
Bugatti sitting still, look like it's going 200
Pussy nigga keep your mouth closed like you chew onions
Mother fucker I'm like
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
Rather be judged by my jewelry, not a jury of my peers
And I got some kush to hide in her brassiere
And we only selling what the boat bring here nigga
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
Cause I got shooters on the roof like some fucking reindeer
And I'm probably with the model of the year
I'm about to go Pac with the nose ring up in here
Uh, lifestyles of the rich and famous
Young Money motherfucking Entertainment
And y'all know Marley got the chopper up in here
Yeah, me, myself and I, the fucking Three Musketeers
Smoke like I fucking disappeared
I check your pussy ass, and wait for it to clear nigga
Tunechi, everybody know your name like Cheers, nigga
Started from the bottom now my whole team here nigga!
Tunechi!

Wheres my coffee?
Good morning Dr. Carter (Hey sweetie)
Looks like it's gonna be a long day
Ahh, another one huh? What we got
Your first patient (Yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concepts (Uh-huh)
Originality (Ugghh)
His flow is weak (Another one)
And he has no style (Ughhh)
What you got for him? (Tssss, okay)

Let me put my gloves on, and my scrubs on
Dr. Carter to the rescue
Excuse me if I'm late, but like a thief it takes
Time to be this great, uhh, so just wait
Your style is a disgrace, your rhymes are fifth place
And I'm just grace, one, uno, ace
And I'm trying make your heart beat like bass
Hmm-mm, but you're sweet like cake
And I come to fix whatever you shall break
Where is your originality? You are so fake
So picture me like a gallery, capture what I say
All I need is one mic, all I need is one take
Like, hey! Brighter than a sun ray
Got a pistol on a playground, watch the gun-play
Like, no kidding, no kids in the way
But the kids do watch, gotta watch what we say
Gotta work everyday, gotta not be cliché
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K
Gotta kick it, kick it like a sensei
You gotta have faith, you gottta, gotta
Wait, wait, I think I, I think I lost him
(Flatline)

Good afternoon Dr. Carter (Nurse)
I don't know about this one
His confidence is down
Vocab and metaphors needs work
And he lacks respect for the game (Uhhhh, let me see)
You think you can save him?

Okay, respect is in the heart, so that's where I'mma start
And a lot of heart patients don't make it
But, hey kid, plural, I graduated
'Cause you can get through anything if Magic made it
And that was called recycling, r-e-reciting something
'Cause you just like it so you say it just like it
Some say it's biting but I say it's enlightening
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
And Dr. Jeezy can fix you back up the nicest
Arthritis in my hand from writing
But I'm a doctor, they don't understand my writing
So I stopped writing, now I'm like lightning
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titan
Fast and exciting, my passion is frightening
Now let me put some more vocab in your IV
Here, take this Vicodin, like it and love it
And confidence has no budget
So pay me no mind, I don't walk it like I talk it 'cause I run it
I don't do it 'cause I done it, and I'm in the emergency un-it
God dunnit I've lost another one
(Flatline)

Good evening Dr. Carter, it's been a long day
But this one looks much better than the others
His respect is back up, concepts sound good
His style is showing strong signs of improvement
All he needs now is his swagger
Okay, let me take my gloves off then

Swagger tighter than a yeast infection
Fly, go hard, like geese, erection
Fashion patrol, police detection
Eyes stay tight like Chinese Connection
I stay tight like pussy at night
Baby, don't get me wrong, I could do that pussy right
But I'm too wrong to right, too fresh to fight
Too paid to freestyle, too paid to freestyle
Had to say it twice, swagger so nice
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price
And I don't rap fast, I rap slow
'Cause I mean every letter in the words
In the sentence of my quotes
Swagger just flows sweeter than honey oats
That swagger, I got it, I wear it like a coat
Wait, as I put the light down his throat
I can only see flow, his blood starting to flow
His lungs starting to grow, this one's starting to show
Strong signs of life, where's the stitches? here's the knife
Smack his face, his eyes open, I reply, "What a night"
"Welcome back, Hip Hop — I saved your life"

Baby, you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

What’s understood ain’t gotta be explained
But you don't understand me
So let me explain
Stood in the heat, the flame
The snow
Please slow down hurricane
The wind blow
My dreads swang
He had hair like wool
Like Wayne
Dropping ashes in the Bible
I shake 'em out
And they fall on the rifle
Scary
Hail Mary
No tale-fairy
All real, very
Extraordinary
Perry Mason facin' the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge; no gown, no gavel
A hound, a rebel
Down to battle
Now or never
Or whenever
And the F for
"Fucking fantastic"
Fuck if you agree
I'm bright
But I don't give a fuck if you see me

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

What's understood ain't gotta be explained
So for those who understand, meet Dwayne
For eight and a half months I gave Miss Cita pain
Now it's Young Money baby, keep the change
My momma say "Fuck em!", and we the same
So hello motherfucker, you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change like Easter Sunday
You know, church fit, then outfit
Bright pink and green chest look house-lit
Bright pinky rings, but that ain't about this
What you 'bout, bitch?
Excuse my French emotion and my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you askin'?
If I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
But I know you don't understand
Cause you thought Little Wayne was Weezy
But Weezy is Wayne

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

I was watchin' TV the other day, right?
Got this white guy on there talking 'bout black guys
Talking about how young black guys are targeted
Targeted by who? America
You see, one in every one hundred Americans are locked up
One in every nine Black Americans are locked up
And see what the White guy was trying to stress was that
The money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail
A young motherfucker to jail
Would be less to send his or her young ass to college
See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that
Our jails are populated with drug dealers
You know, crack cocaine? Yeah, stuff like that
Meaning, due to the laws we have on crack cocaine
And regular cocaine
The police are... only
I don't want to say only right, but shit
Only logic, by riding around in the hood all day
And not in the suburbs
Because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
And um, you know, the other thing is mostly found –
You know where I'm going
But why bring a motherfucka to jail
If it's not gonna stand up in court
Because this drug ain't that drug
You know; level three, level four drug, shit like that
Mhmm... I guess it's all a misunderstanding
And um, I sit back and think, well shit, us young motherfuckers
You know, that one in every nine
We probably only selling the crack cocaine
Just because we in the hood
And it's not like your suburbs
We don't have the things that you have
Why? I really don't want to know the answer
But, I guess we just misunderstood huh? Yeah
You know we don't have room in the jail now
For the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know
Sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that
Oh, don't get scared, don't get scared
I know you saw one of them sex offender papers
Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mmmhmm
Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you
Sex offender, on the level 3 drug
Convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out
And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got
Yeah, well you know what? (coughing)
Don't stop the track, that's the good weed
You know what, I have a fucking daughter
You understand me?
And, why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail
Just because the reason why he live next door to me
Ain't the reason why I live next door to him
Meanin', he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood
He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood
You move him out, bring him to jail for life
And then you move in a sex offender, hahahah
They giving me a paper, hahah
Is that a misunderstanding, cause I don't understand it
Another thing, let me take my glasses off
Cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this
Uhh, Mr. Al Sharpton; here's why I don't respect you
And nobody like you, hmm-hmm, see
You're the type that gets off, on gettin' on other people, hahah
That's not good, no homo
And rather unhuman I should say
I mean, given the fact that humanity
Well, good humanity, rather
To me, is helping one another, no matter your color or race
But this guy, and people like him
They'd rather speculate before they informate
If that's a word, heh heh
You know, 'spect before check, anyway
Meanin', I much rather you talk to me first and see if you
Can learn an opinion before you make one
Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton (heh heh)
Hold on, I ain't finished wit' you man
Gotta pluck the ashes, mhmm, hold on, um
Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you, you don't know me
So, if you're not gonna try to
Then what you say or think about me, or whatever I do
Is totally Casper the Friendly Ghost to me
And, it doesn't make you a good person
To criticize before you improvise
Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither
But the characteristics fall heavily into bad sway (Hahah)
But, since I am human, I am good and bad as well
But I try my hardest to stay good
And some of the things I do and say may be bad
Or just, not too good
But I do try
So with that said, I don't fault you
I mean, you're only human
Good or bad, but I also don't respect you
And I don't care if that's good or bad, heh heh
You see, you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson
You're a nobody, to me
You're just another Don King with a perm
Just a little more political
And that just means you're a little unhuman than us humans
And now, let me be human by saying fuck Al Sharpton
And anyone like him
Fuck if you understand me
I love being misunderstood
Heheh, why?
Cause I live in the suburbs, but I come from the hood
Bring the hook in

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Turn the music down in my headphones, yeah
That noise in the background, that's my skateboard
That nigga Mack crazy
Yeah, uh

I put my shooters on they feet
I just give 'em your address, then go to sleep
The money turned my niggas into monsters
The white done turned my niggas into Nazis, Lord
The money turned my face into a stocking
Don't make me turn your baby to a hostage, boy
Don't make me turn the kid to a foster
My woman turn my dick into a Mazda, Lord
Body parts in the duffel
The bullets turn your body to a puzzle
The money turn my bitch into a monster
She know how to get a check and turn a zero to a comma, Lord
The money turn my niggas into killas
The sugar turnt the cocaine to vanilla
The money turnt the bitches into hoes
The money turned my niggas into foes, Lord
I put my shooters on they feet
Give 'em your address, then I go out to eat
Had that snowman in the hood like Jody Breeze
She from the hood but look like she from overseas
I said, "Girl you know I love you and I care for ya
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya"
She say, "Fuck these other niggas, they ain't half of ya
Just keep laughing to the bank, it's hilarious"
I got a stay-at-home gun and a travel gun
Boy, we could sell white, in Africa
It's like, I can't explain, y'all asked me to spit
And now I'm drooling on my chain
What happened to Wayne?

I'm like, hold up, wait a second
Y'all thought I was second?
Hating on a champ
Throwing salt and not confetti
We pull up and we shoot
Then we park the car and edit
Watch me pull up with no roof
That's cause I walk the dog and pet it
I'm like, hold up, wait a minute
Y'all thought I was finished?
Shoot you in your head
Then just walk off like I didn't
Let my money talk so much
Put my jawbone outta business
Doing numbers in this bitch
I'm like a smart phone with the digits
Bitch

Riding 'round with the volume down
With the windows up and the choppers down
Soon as we get to your block
It's the motherfuckin' other way around
My bitch say I'm too wild
She don't even know why she stay around
I get home and I dick her down
Now she talkin' bout exchanging vows
If these bullets was paintballs
I could fuck around and I could paint a house
You could tell I'm pimpin'
The way I hit the blunt with my pinkie out
I bring wine to Amy house
We smoke it out and we drank it out
And talk about these pussy niggas
That ain't about what Wayne about
I'm hangin out a Mulsanne without a brain, it's out of its mind
I pull over, I push a button, it change like Optimus Prime
Speaking of change, it's a shame how these lames droppin' them dimes
We aim at your grape, knock it off, now you just vines
Blood Gang, red rain on these niggas, hot if you dry
My gang top of the line, hollerin' out "Squad, take it outside"
I'm a tax payer, I'm a axe player, gettin' in through the back well
Red devil to the blue collared, un-enveloped black mail
Fed up with the fed shit and Fed-Ex lost my package
My white girls say "Yeah, nigga," my white homies act blackish
Ain't tall enough for the NBA, I ain't big enough for the NFL
Should've been in N.W.A., fuck the police, Five-0 and 12
One time for your mind, bitch, never say nevermind, bitch
You a penny short of a dime, bitch, no nonsense, had a nine since
I was nine, bitch
Yeah, born to murder
Bank account on fat, bustin' out the girdle
Tell 'em boys ain't nothin' sweet, it's sauerkraut, ya heard me?
They find ya body in New Orleans on Mardi Gras on Bourbon
Like, oh, Lord, Humphrey Bogart
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a crowbar
For the most part, I'm the southern coast guard
AK-47 spittin' flame like a blow torch

Dead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead, sir
He's dead chap, that man's dead back there
It's worse than dead, his brain is gone

(Kane is in the building, nigga)

I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming my name like that
I never see your crazy face (Mula)
Smiling, laughing, screaming my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming my name
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming my name

Dead man walkin', through a dead plant garden
Red ants army, Caveman Spartan
Die, come back to life, shaved and corporate
I paved and carved it, made man forfeit
Laid and chalked him, I slaved then bossed it
I don't need flowers around my grave, I need maids and doormen
We not one and the same;
Casper the Friendly, Tunechi Cobain
Ask how I'm livin'? I can't complain
Like, it's hot in hell, but it never rain
Shit never sweet, him never changed
I'll always be the MF'er Wayne
I been lost conscious, I never regain
Bitches wanna sleep with my remains, lawd

Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I just double parked the hearse by a fire hydrant
They throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen
Rest In Peace to the Cash Money Weezy
Gone but not forgotten, no

I never see your crazy face
(You don't see me, nigga)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
(You don't see me, nigga, no)
I never see your crazy face
(You can't see me, nigga)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
(You can't see me, nigga, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
(You can't see me, nigga, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
(I'm the muthafuckin' ghost)

Dead man walkin', the weed I'm sparkin'
Stank like corpses, got a young nigga coughin'
I was larger than life, should've got a bigger coffin
Bad bitches in my coffin, suck dick 'til they cough
How long will they mourn me?
I had a Rolls Royce Ghost
Now I'm feelin like that motherfucka comin' back to haunt me
We are not one and the same;
I fumble my brain, I'm nothin' but strange
I punctured my veins, I'm loving the pain
I'm ugly and vain, now go get that shovel and dump it on Wayne
Throw dirt on my name, picture on a shirt instead of a frame
I'm dead as a doorknob and I got it locked
So fuck every key on your key chain, boy

Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I don't know if I'm comin' or goin, Lord, I'm undecided
Throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen
Rest In Peace to the Cash Money Weezy, gone but not forgotten

(No) I never see your crazy face (Ohhh)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
(You don't see me, nigga, no)
I never see your crazy face (You can't see me, nigga)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
(You can't see me, nigga, no, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
(You can't see me, nigga, no, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
(I'm the muthafuckin' ghost)
I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that

(Money on my mind) That's right
(So money is all I think of) That's right
(Money on my mind) Bitch, you know
(So money is all I think of) Bitch, bitch, ayy

Stepping out the motherfucking car, they in awe
I'm looking like a star, bitch, when you see me make a wish
Holla at your motherfucking boy, J.R
Birdman my pa, bitch, ball bred, born rich (yeah)
Dear Mr. Toilet, I'm the shit
Got these other haters pissed, 'cause my toilet paper thick
I know, but trip and that .40 make a chip
Out a potato-head wimp, then, like ranch, I dip
And the hustle is all muscle, just strength
When it comes to that weight I don't struggle, I just lift (one-two)
I got my hand on the game, yeah I make a grip
Hundred grand in my fist, same on my wrist
Get ki money from a quarter, blame it on my wrist
I whip coke like hoes, nigga, I'm a pimp
Lil nigga 'bout to rape the market
If we talking 'bout money, baby, now we talking

Yeah, fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Get money, get money, get money
Get money, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money

Nigga, get it in a slump, if you know how
In the heart of the summer, we need a snow plow
What you know about that? Baby, it's your time
Coke transactions on the phone, we call it "blow jobs"
Too fast for the feds, too cocky for the cops
Had to ditch my old bitch, getting sloppy with the pots (bitch!)
Hopping off the boat, meeting Papi at the docks
He tell me I'm gaining weight, I tell him I'm getting paid
Money Over Bitches, I'm yelling it to the grave
Developed at a young age, go after what pays
These Gabbana sunshades block the sun rays
I drop a car note in the mall on the first date
I gotta get it even if it's in the worst way
That cake, like it's-it's my birthday
New Orleans my birthplace, ya heard me?
Where money's more important than a person

Twisting up a blunt, thinking 'bout my next dollar
I'm digging in the game tryna get some money out her
I'm so vain, it's a problem
There ain't a stain on these Pradas, I'm just being modest
Got me a goddess, show her how to divide it
She still down and she don't get none of the profit
Wheel around the city, let the tints hide me
"That's a cold motherfucker, whoever inside it"
Forever symbolizing the grind, it don't walk to you
I make it run like horses do
Giddy-up, baby, if he got it, then hit him up baby
I know it's crazy, but I can't get enough baby
I love it, I fucking love it
I'm a self-made millionaire, fuck the public
Riding to myself, 'cause I don't fuck with nothing
Pistol on my lap on the way to the money!

I'ma just say this shit right here
The greatest mixtape series of all time
Care to debate me?
Uh-uh-uh-mmm
Yea, I thought so
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Keep that shit on Twitter, y'all ain't lit, y'all litter
Keep that shit in your shitter, or eat that shit, don't spit up, rrr!
Keep my bad bitch did up, keep my main bitch, put up
Watchin' me do push-ups
She was playin' with herself and I looked up, damn!
Your thot need to get her look up
You plottin' on me, my foot up
Your squad ain't hard, that's cushion
That ain't sauce, that's puddin'
Tunechi across her bosom, damn!
Shootin' up the jurors, damn!
Don't name my pistol, I name the trigger
Benjamin Button, push 'em, bam!
Y'all just pussy, get buried together and let 'em play footsie
Y'all just wussy, I got some bullets
Gon' pull up in hoodies and come take a look-see
Better play hooky, I got some hookers
Hookin' up with some politicans and some athletes
And some college niggas, send your missus on all kind of missions
I'm the sickest nigga skippin' doctors visits
But my pots is pissy, smokin' hockey sticky
Put a stockin' on my face and hit a lick in'
When this shit get ugly, I go Pretty Ricky
I don't fuck with rats, neither Minnie, Micky
I don't fuck with cops, that's the piggly wiggly
Fuck my bitch's friends, and they friendly-friendly
While your bitch givin' me her twenty-twenty
Like she tired of Mickey-D's, Wendy's, Denny's
Like she tired of Macy's, JC Penny's
I got bitches gettin' tired of spendin', spend it
If we winnin', win it
I know dreamchasers that ain't never dreamt it
So I had to tint it and I had to rim it
And I worked the lanes like Shaq and Penny
It's the Blood gang, it's the money gang
Red rags to riches, need happy endings
Then it's back to business and we laugh at sentencin'
Hungry lawyers make a snack out witnesses
Hungry artists or starvin' artists
In the kitchen, restaurant and cafeterias
Don't make a difference if you taste the difference
Better pay the difference to the racketeers
Now your good luck lookin' like you crackin' mirrors
Now the artificial become sacrificial
That's a body count, where the mathematician?
Where the wettest clitoris and fattest nipples?
With an ass that jiggle with a grab or tickle
With a throat deep enough to land a missile
If your nigga miss you and he have opinions
Tell him two cents is only half a nickel
Now we at his villa, aiming at his pillows
Hair triggers, fingers finna act like bristles
And I catch a triple, flip, kick, jiu-jitsu
Throwin' pool parties, she don't have a swimsuit
Neither of her friends do, I think that's official
Got my neighbor's eyes bigger than the Simpsons
And her man is simple so I had to pimp her
And she had potential but he lacked credentials
So give me a sec', I'll go at your neck
And send you back lookin' like the Dracula bit you, rrra!
Yeah, cannibalism goin' animalistic in a land of civilians
These niggas clones, copycats, and chameleons
Once they dead and gone, no paraphernalia
When she left her thong, that's paraphernalia
Sound familiar? My plug's Sicilian
He the one who told me that sometimes
You gotta leave ya la familia, behind the millions
Rhyme or reason, I'm the reason
Got they eyes wide but too blind to see it
With friends like those
It make me text all my enemies and tell 'em I don't need 'em
Hallelujah, power intruders
Bitch walk around my house like Hooters
Towel user, power user
Molly mixed with white girl, Molly/Susan
Niggas talkin' out their bowel movers
Turn they homies into flower choosers
Turn your kids into father choosers
Make your bitch a widow and your mom a cougar
I'm a silent shooter with a silent shooter
Clap at you, if you don't die, I'll boo ya
Tell a doc that's tryna to save your life
And runnin' wires through you, he could die next to ya, rrr!
I'ma make the nurse ride me like a giant scooter
Let her partner shoot it, we pull out the movie, win awards
She got a Golden Globe head and an Oscar booty
Niggas prostitutin', these rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Not even 'bout pollution
Ain't got a house to live in, ain't got a pool to swim in
Change in their pockets, nor a couch to lose it
In route to Houston with a contribution
Full of Monster juices, monster too slow
Macho, Cujo, macho mucho
Big bad wolf, watch the moon glow, rrrr!
I got a Greek freak, she call me Antetokounmpo
Just follow the kupo and I know that you know
I'm hotter than soup, she still swallow my soup bowl
I'm out of my loophole, you outta the loop, though
Got all these niggas on silent and mute mode
The power to do so, my pockets is sumo
Gettin' the mula by the minuto
Mafia Nuvo, I am the uno
Real boss nigga, should model for Hugo
Fuck with me, I go Lolapaloozo
Pull up trigger finger, holler, and pull up
Pow, pow, pow, sound like a symphony
Or opera, two-door, hittin' some new notes
And I am the maestro and you just a typo
Private flight, don't fly in too low
I'm wiser than you know, a private school flow
I got me a new ho and now it's a duo
One went to college and one went to ju-co
I had to ask 'em, what's four plus two though? Rrr!

Yeah, yeah!
I need a Winn-Dixie grocery bag full of money (whoo!)
Right now to the VIP section (whoo!)

Now I was bouncing through the club
She love the way I diddy-bop
I see her boyfriend hatin' like a city cop
Now I ain't never been a chicken but my fifty cocked
Say I ain't never been a chicken but my semi cocked
Now where your bar at? I'm tryna rent it out
And we so bout it bout it, now what are you about?
DJ showin' love he say my name when the music stop
"Young Money, Lil Wayne" then the music drop
I make it snow, I make it flurry
I make it all back tomorrow, don't worry

Now clap your hands if you got a bankroll (Chris)
Like some clap on lights in this bitch
I'mma be clappin' all night in this bitch
Lights off, mask on
Creep silent, she smiling
He muggin', who cares
Cause my goons, are right here
Like it's nothing, to a big dog
And I'm a Great Dane, I wear 8 chains
I mean so much ice, they yell, "Skate, Wayne!"
She wanna fuck Weezy but she wanna rape Wayne
(And I'mma let her)

If you got money (yeah) and you know it (yeah)
Then take it out your pocket and show it then throw it like

A.K.A Mr. Make-it-Rain-On-Them-Hoes
Like ayyy! And everybody say
Mr. Rainman can we have a rainy day?
Bring an umbrella, please bring an umbrella
'Ella, 'ella, 'ella, ayyy!
Bitch ain't shit but a ho and a trick
But you know it ain't trickin' if you got it
You know we ain't fuckin if you not thick
And I'll cool your ass down if you think you're hot shit
So Rolex watch this, I do it, four, five, six
My click-clack goes the black four-fifth
And just like it I'll blow that shit
Cause bitch I'm the bomb like tick, tick
BIATCH!

AKA Mr. Make-It-Rain-On-Them-Hoes
Yeah, young Wayne on the hoes
Make a stripper fall in love, T-Pain on them hoes
Uh-huh... um, Young Mula baby

Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
It's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser

Goons in this bitch, leave a nigga on a stretcher
It's all there papa, you ain't even got to measure
Laughing at how my old bitches look jealous
Well what goes around comes around, propellers
Money Over Bitches, M.O.B, goodfellas
Cut our ears off, ain't shit you could tell us
Write your name on the bullet, that's a fuckin' love letter
If I ain't a trendin' topic, I'm a fuckin' trend-setter, I'm on

If you're scared, go to church, Mason Betha
Sometimes the paper chase could be like chasin' a leopard
The pussy wetter, wetter than it's ever been
But she gone probably try to cross the line like a Mexican
I ain't on that bullshit, shorty fine as fuck though
Now she kiss me on my neck, I hope she ain't cut-throat
Cut down on the syrup cause it made me fuck slow
Shoot so many times I'mma choke off the gunsmoke
Life, death, love, hate, pleasure, pain
Pay me no mind but I don't have change
I cock back and aim at your membrane
Broad day, no mask, close range

Your bullshit is stinkin' up the place
Me no tek bad up, me a done de place
Can't let these bitch niggas slide and touch base
I make her cum so many times, call her "nutcase"
It's Young Money baby, take your clothes off
Give me them three holes, bowlin' ball
Two shots of whatever
Keep them bitches cummin' and she gon' do whatever
